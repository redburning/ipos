L-ornithine is an amino acid, but it is not a component of proteins nor is it coded for by DNA. In mammals, it plays a role in the urea cycle for the disposal of ammonia where it is synthesized from L-arginine by arginase 1. It is also a precursor of L-arginine synthesis in the urea cycle and citrulline-nitric oxide cycle.

About this Pathway:
This pathway describes the de novo biosynthesis of L-ornithine from 2-oxoglutarate which occurs in the mitochondria.

L-glutamate is formed from 2-oxoglutarate within the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenases [Shashidharan94]. L-glutamate is then converted to L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde by mitochondrial ¦Ä-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase [Aral96].

L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde can spontaneously cyclize to (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, an intermediate in L-proline biosynthesis.

The conversion of L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde to L-ornithine occurs within the mitochondrial lumen by ornithine aminotransferase [Kobayashi89].

At this point, L-ornithine can enter either citrulline-nitric oxide cycle or urea cycle to synthesize L-arginine.",NA,

The polyamines are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes [Tabor85, Abraham68, Frydman92, Huang90]. The most common are putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.

While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully understand their specific molecular functions in vivo [Tabor85]. Putrescine and spermidine are found in all life forms, while spermine is found mostly in eukaryotes.

Unlike spermidine, spermine is not essential for viability in eukaryotes. Exogenous spermine supported growth of spermidine-depleted cells only after its degradation into spermidine [Kramer96].

About this Pathway:
Spermine is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to spermidine, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed spermine synthase [Kajander89]. The source of the propylamine group is S-adenosyl 3-(methylsulfanyl)propylamine, a decarboxylated S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase [Xiong99].

Asparagine is the amide of L-aspartate and is not an essential amino acid. The amide group carries no charge under physiological pH and is readily hydrolyzed, converting L-asparagine back to L-aspartate. This process is thought to be one of several, related to the molecular basis for aging. Asparagine has a high propensity to hydrogen bond and is a common site of attachment for carbohydrates in N-linked glycosylation. It was the first amino acid to be isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice.

About this Pathway

The synthesis of L-asparagine starts with oxaloacetate in a transamination reaction catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase 1 [DAniello05]. In mammals, L-aspartate is converted to L-asparagine in a reaction catalyzed by asparagine synthetase using L-glutamine as an amide donor [Van89]. The reaction requires magnesium ions and ATP and involves formation of a ¦Â-aspartyladenylate intermediate which is converted to L-asparagine by transfer of ammonia from L-glutamine to yield L-glutamate and AMP [Balasubramanian13].

There is considerable interest in asparagine metabolism since the discovery that asparaginases have anti-tumor activity in certain cancers, see L-asparagine degradation. Some tumors develop resistance to asparaginase treatment and this often correlates with higher asparagine synthetase activity.",NA,

Asparagine is the amide of L-aspartate and is not an essential amino acid. It is synthesized in humans from oxaloacetate in L-asparagine biosynthesis. The amide group carries no charge under physiological pH and is readily hydrolyzed, converting L-asparagine back to L-aspartate.

Asparagine has a high propensity to hydrogen bond and is a common site of attachment for carbohydrates in N-linked glycosylation. It was the first amino acid to be isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice.

About this Pathway

There are at least three human enzymes capable of hydrolyzing the amino acid L-asparagine to L-aspartate. The most studied is the lysosomal N(4)-(beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparaginase (AGA) which removes carbohydrate groups linked to asparagine, in the final step of cell surface glycoprotein degradation [Oinonen95]. It also has asparagine hydrolase activity.

The enzymes 60 kDa lysophospholipase and isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase catalyze the hydrolysis of L-asparagine to L-aspartate and ammonium [Nomme12]. The latter enzyme also exhibits ¦Â-aspartyl peptidase activity consistent with enzymes designated as plant-type asparaginases, cleaving a ¦Â-linked Asp residue from the N-terminus of a polypeptide.

The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase 1 catalyzes the transamination of L-aspartate to oxaloacetate which can subsequently enter either the TCA cycle or gluconeogenesis.

Asparaginases play a prominent role in chemotherapy, as cancer cells are dependent on the availability of extracellular L-asparagine (ASN). ASN depletion by administration of bacterial asparaginases interferes with the metabolism of the cancer cell leading to apoptosis [Nomme12]. None of the three human asparaginases have the required intrinsic kinetic property (low Km) for replacing bacterial asparaginases in chemotherapy. Recombinant isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase could be a substitute for the bacterial enzymes, if it can be modified to have enhanced catalytic activity [Nomme14].

The isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase may act synergistically with protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase to relieve accumulation of potentially toxic isoaspartyl peptides in mammalian brain and other tissues [Cantor09]. Formation of isoaspartyl peptide bonds occurs via the spontaneous degradation of peptides and proteins. This can decrease the biological activity of a protein, altering its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and elicit autoimmunity [Aswad00].",NA,

¦Â-alanine is a naturally occurring ¦Â-amino acid found in animals, plants and microorganisms [Stinson69]. It differs from L-alanine (an ¦Á-amino acid) in the position of the amino group on the ¦Â carbon, rather than the ¦Á carbon.

¦Â-Alanine is synthesized in the liver, primarily by uracil degradation I (reductive). Unlike L-alanine, ¦Â-alanine is not incorporated into proteins. In mammals, much of the cellular pool of ¦Â-alanine is incorporated into the dipeptide carnosine.

There is considerable research interest in the possible role of ¦Â-alanine and carnosine as neurotransmitters. The inhibitory neurotransmitter ¦Ã-aminobutyrate (GABA) is also a substrate for liver transaminases. ¦Â-alanine can also be transaminated by a pyruvate-dependent enzyme in liver [Kontani99].

About this Pathway

¦Â-alanine is converted to 3-oxopropanoate by transamination of 2-oxoglutarate to L-glutamate [Schor01]. Malonate semialdehyde is then converted to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by oxidative decarboxylation [Kedishvili92].

The enzyme methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase [acylating] is involved in both ¦Â-alanine degradation and L-valine degradation [Goodwin89]. This enzyme is unique among aldehyde dehydrogenases in its CoA dependency. It has been proposed that the formation of a CoA ester allows energy conservation during aldehyde oxidation [Harris93, Kedishvili92].",NA,

The enzyme can also catalyze conversion of lactose to allolactose (¦Â-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-6)-D-glucopyranose) by transglycosylation, and can hydrolyze allolactose (in [Huber80]). Allolactose is the physiological inducer of this pathway.

Further metabolism of glucose and galactose inside the cell is thought to proceed by their initial transport out of the cell, followed by reentry. It has been shown that when lactose is added to a growing culture of Escherichia coli, galactose, glucose and allolactose reach high levels inside the cells and are rapidly effluxed into the medium [Huber80]. It has also been shown that an Escherichia coli mutant defective in the uptake of glucose and galactose grew poorly with lactose as a sole carbon source. Additional transport rate and radiotracer studies supported the efflux mechanism [Huber84]. No Escherichia coli genes specifically involved in sugar efflux during lactose metabolism have been conclusively identified. However, SetA and SetB, members of the SET (sugar efflux transporter) family may have a role [Liu99, Liu99a].

It has been suggested that as glucose reenters the cell it could be phosphorylated to glucose-1-phosphate by the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (in [Huber80]). Glucose-1-phosphate could then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase and enter glycolysis. Galactose could reenter the cell by facilitated diffusion (in [Huber80]), or active transport systems galP, or mgl (Lin in [Neidhardt96]). Galactose can also be converted to glucose-1-phosphate (Fraenkel in [Neidhardt96]). (See EcoCyc pathways: glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation; galactose degradation I; and superpathway of glycolysis and Entner-Doudoroff).

The E. coli lacZ gene coding for ¦Â-galactosidase is the first of three structural genes of the historically significant lac operon. The study of this operon provided the primary basis for the original operon concept [Jacob61]. Lactose and other galactosides are transported into the cell by lactose permease, the product of the second structural gene of the operon [Abramson03]. The third structural gene codes for galactoside acetyltransferase (thiogalactoside transacetylase). The proposed function of this enzyme is acetylation of potentially toxic pyranosides that are exported from the cell, thereby preventing their reentry [Wang02b]. A review of biochemical studies of the three lac enzymes by Zabin and Fowler can be found in [Miller78].

Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that exists either free-living, or in a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing relationship in root nodules of leguminous plants such as alfalfa ( Medicago sativa) (in [Capela01]). R. meliloti requires large amounts of metabolic energy for nitrogen fixation and can utilize many compounds as carbon sources, including ¦Á-galactosides and ¦Â-galactosides [Bringhurst02] and reviewed in [Stowers85]. Nomenclature note: Sinorhizobium meliloti is also known as Sinorhizobium meliloti ( [Aneja99] and URL cited in [Galibert01]).

In Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm2011 (a derivative of SU47), two distinct ¦Â-galactosidase activities are present, one that is inducible, and another that is constitutive at a low level [Niel77] . The inducible ¦Â-galactosidase activity is necessary for growth on lactose, as mutants lacking the inducible enzyme cannot use lactose as a sole carbon source. The lactose utilization locus is located on the megaplasmid pRmeSU47b, one of the two megaplasmids present in R. meliloti. There is evidence to suggest that succinate also plays a role in regulating Rhizobium lactose utilization. R. meliloti grown on both lactose and succinate preferentially utilize succinate, repressing the inducible ¦Â-galactosidase activity even in the presence of lactose.

Unlike Escherichia coli, further catabolism of ¦Â-D-galactose in rhizobia is poorly understood [Timblin84]. Glucose catabolism in most rhizobia proceeds via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as reviewed in [Stowers85].

In Homo sapiens (humans), lactose is hydrolyzed by the intestinal enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.108 (click on the link for details). This enzyme differs in substrate specificity from human intestinal ¦Â-galactosidase [Asp69]",NA,

Choline plays a key role in several pathways and its concentration in vivo is carefully regulated. Choline is an essential nutrient for fetal and brain development. It is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in humans and is metabolized to produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via choline O-acetyltransferase, or catabolized to glycine betaine [Salvi13]. Glycine betaine plays an important osmoprotectant role in mammals, protects from several other forms of cellular stress and functions as a methyl group donor [Lever10]. In mammals, choline degradation is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation [Mehedint10][Zeisel12].

This pathway continues as glycine betaine degradation II (mammalian) and is linked to folate transformations I, through the use of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate as a coenzyme for several of the reactions in glycine betaine degradation II (mammalian).

About This Pathway:
The conversion of choline to glycine betaine is performed by the action of two dehydrogenases and occurs in the mitochondria.

Coenzyme A is a crucial cofactor in all living organisms. It functions as an acyl carrier and carbonyl-activating group in numerous central biochemical transformations, including the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism [Rubio06]. It is estimated that about 4% of all known enzymes require CoA as an obligate cofactor [Begley01].

While many organisms are capable of de novo CoA biosynthesis from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate and L-aspartate via (R)-pantothenate (vitamin B5), animals and some pathogenic microbes require exogenous (R)-pantothenate for CoA synthesis. In mammals, a deficiency of vitamin B5 can cause many systemic consequences such as impaired motor response, depressed heme synthesis and altered growth. Levels of CoA can also be affected by metabolic stress such as starvation, alcoholism, diabetes and some cancers [Tahiliani91].

About This Pathway:
The biosynthesis of coenzyme A from (R)-pantothenate is an essential universal pathway in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Despite significant variations in the sequence of individual enzymatic components, the overall topology of CoA biosynthetic appears to be preserved in all taxons. In mammals, it consists of five enzymatic steps. In the first step, the pantothenate kinases phosphorylate pantothenate to (R)-4'-phosphopantothenate, and are feedback inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis.

The addition of L-cysteine results in the formation of (R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl-L-cysteine in an ATP dependent reaction catalyzed by phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase [Daugherty02]. This is in contrast to the E. coli ortholog which utilizes CTP for the reaction [Strauss01].

Next, phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase mediates the decarboxylation of (R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl-L-cysteine to 4'-phosphopantetheine [Strauss04]. In the last two steps of the pathway, bifunctional coenzyme A synthase converts 4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA [Aghajanian02].

The first two enzymes of the pathway are present in all eukaryotes but are consistently fused in many bacteria and archaea. In contrast, a fusion event for the last two enzymes in the pathway occurred in mammals and flies, but not in plants, fungi or prokaryotes.

The conservation of this pathway in biological systems, allowed the efficient use of comparative genome analysis to visualize the mosaic of conserved genes and reveal previously uncharacterized genes in the human CoA biosynthetic pathway [Genschel04].",NA,

Mammalian metabolism of ingested L-cysteine occurs primarily within the liver. The liver stringently regulates its intracellular cysteine pool within a narrow range to maintain the cysteine catabolic and anabolic pathways and prevent cysteine toxicity [Dominy06]. There are at least two degradation pathways for cysteine in mammals, this pathway and L-cysteine degradation III.

About this Pathway:
This pathway probably describes the major route of cysteine degradation which starts by the oxidation of cysteine to 3-sulfino-L-alanine catalyzed by cysteine dioxygenase [Yamaguchi87]. The conversion of L-cysteine to 3-sulfino-L-alanine forms a branch point.

In the continuation of this pathway, 3-sulfino-L-alanine is transaminated by aspartate aminotransferase 1 to 3-sulfinopyruvate, which spontaneously degrades to pyruvate and sulfite [Weinstein88][Singer56]. The sulfite is oxidized by sulfite oxidase to sulfate and excreted in the urine [Bella95]

A second route involves the decarboxylation of 3-sulfino-L-alanine to form hypotaurine by in taurine biosynthesis I. The relative use of these two pathways shows tissue specificity [Griffith87].",NA,

All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses such as drought, air pollutants, UV light and high light intensities, chilling temperatures and external chemicals [Van99a, Alscher02]. For example, active oxygen species are produced during the ¦Â-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms [Frugoli96]. ROS such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals as well as hydrogen peroxide can cause significant damage to proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles.

Most of the aerobic organisms have developed defense systems to face oxidative stress and to scavenge oxidative radicals in the form of enzymes that can detoxify ROS, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydroperoxidase (CAT) [Beyer87]. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of the mustard family (oilseed plants), stores energy reserves preliminary as lipids that undergo ¦Â-oxidation during germination. The hydrogen peroxide that is produced during this metabolic process is detoxified by catalase. Another form of ROS, superoxide radicals, are by-products of aerobic electron transfer chains, and are disposed of by the action of superoxide dismutase. Since ROS can be found in any compartment of the eukaryotic cell, organisms have developed small gene families encoding for several SOD and CAT enzymes that operate in the various cell compartments [Kliebenstein98, McClung97].

About This Pathway:
SODs represent the first line of defense against ROS, converting superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and water. SODs are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor. There are iron-dependent, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SODs, which differ not only in their metal cofactor but also in their subcellular location. In plants, FeSODs are located in chloroplasts and are regarded the most ancient SOD group. MnSODs are found in the mitochondrion and the peroxisome and are structurally very similar to FeSODs. The last group, the Cu-ZnSODs operates in chloroplasts, the cytosol and even the extracellular space. They are structurally very different from the other two SOD groups because of the different electrical properties of copper in comparison to iron or manganese, which resulted in a major structural change in the protein [Alscher02].

To date seven SODs have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, three of them iron-dependent, three having copper as metal cofactor and one manganese-dependent SOD [Hindges92, Van90, Kliebenstein98]. It has been demonstrated that a copper-chaperone (AtCCS, At1g12520) is crucial for the activation of all three Cu/Zn-dependent SODs in this organism. The SOD holoenzyme usually constitutes either a homodimer or a homotetramer. However, the exact composition of the SODs in Arabidopsis is currently not known and remains to be verified (here displayed as polypeptides).

Catalase is second in the defense line against active oxygen, converting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Three genes encoding subunits of catalase and at least 6 catalase isoenzymes have been identified in Arabidopsis so far [Zhong94, McClung97, Frugoli96, Zhong96]. Besides their implication in detoxifying ROS, catalases are thought to play a role in the signal transduction pathway in plants leading to the development of SAR (systemic aquired resistance) [Jones94]. The functional protein of catalase is a tetramer but the question whether it exists as homo- or heterotetramer of different subunits remains to be investigated.",NA,

When odd number fatty acids are broken down, a three-carbon residue results, propionylCoA. This is further catabolized by the reactions of proprionate catabolism. Unsaturated fatty acids, with cis double bonds located at odd-numbered carbon atoms, enter the main pathway of saturated fatty acid degradation by converting related metabolites of cis configuration and D stereoisomers, derived from breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids, to the trans- or L isomers of saturated fatty acid breakdown by an isomerase and an epimerase, respectively. When cis double bonds are located at even-numbered carbon atoms, such as linoleic acid (cis,cis(9,12)-octadecadienoic acid), after the fatty acid is degraded to the ten carbon stage an extra step is required to deal with the resulting compound, trans,¦Ä(2)-cis,¦Ä(4)decadienoyl-CoA. The enzyme 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, E.C. 1.3.1.34, converts this to trans,¦Ä(2)decenoyl-CoA which enters the normal cycle at the point of the isomerase.",NA,

Because it enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system (PTS), the first intracellular species is N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate. Following the sequential removal of its acetyl and amino groups, it enters glycolysis as D-fructose-6-phosphate and hence flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy.

GABA and L-glutamate are the most abundant neurotransmitters in mammalian brain. While GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, L-glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. Both are key mediators of synaptic plasticity and neuroendocrine function [Lynex04].
Disturbances in the homeostasis of GABA in the brain are implicated in the development of epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, and Stiff-Man syndrome [Lynex04].
The GABA shunt serves two functions, it can mediate both the catabolism of GABA and channels L-glutamate to the TCA cycle, bypassing two steps of that cycle [Olsen99].

About this Pathway:
This pathway forms a closed loop whose function is the production and conservation of the supply of GABA in the central nervous system across a variety of neural cells. The first step is the transamination of 2-oxoglutarate formed in the TCA cycle, to L-glutamate by the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenases [Shashidharan94]. In the next step, the cytosolic glutamate decarboxylases GAD67 and GAD65 catalyze the decarboxylation of L-glutamate to GABA [Solimena98].
GABA then enters the mitochondrion, where the two mitochondrial enzymes are located [Bouche04]. 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase catalyzes the conversion of GABA to succinate semialdehyde [Yoon04]. To conserve the available supply of GABA, this transamination only occurs when 2-oxoglutarate is present to accept the amino group removed from GABA, reforming L-glutamate [Bessman53].
The last enzyme of the pathway, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of succinate semialdehyde to succinate [Blasi02]. The latter compound reenters the TCA cycle and GABA can be resynthesized from 2-oxoglutarate.
Epileptic convulsions can be controlled by administering drug inhibitors of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase. One such drug which is used in the treatment of some types of epilepsy is vigabatrin [deBittencourt94].",NA,

L-glutamate is a non-essential amino acid. It plays an essential role in the central nervous system as an excitatory neurotransmitter involved in long term potentiation which is vital for learning and memory. Glutamate is also a precursor of L-proline, L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-glutamine and the inhibitory neurotransmitter 4-aminobutanoate [Voet04].

About this Pathway:
Both the biosynthesis and degradation of L-glutamate occur in the mitochondrion. The glutamate dehydrogenases catalyze both the reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate with ammonia to form L-glutamate, and the oxidative deamination of L-glutamate back to 2-oxoglutarate and ammonia [Salway04]. The pathway is is an NAD(P)-dependent one.

The deamination of L-glutamate also occurs during the degradation of several other amino acids. L-arginine, L-glutamine, L-histidine, and L-proline are all converted to L-glutamate during their catabolism [Schmidt88].",NA,

Thiols play several major roles in the cell; they help maintain protein sulfhydryl groups in a reduced state, fight reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, are involved in the detoxification of foreign compounds and act as an enzyme cofactor and amino acid transport [Uhlig92][Sekura74]. In most eukaryotes, the major thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (¦Ã-Glu-Cys-Gly). Its abundance, relatively low redox potential and high stability conferred by the unusual peptidase-resistant ¦Ã-glutamyl bond, are three of the properties that make glutathione an important cellular redox buffer.
Low glutathione levels have been associated with the pathology of several diseases including ulcerative colitis, type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease [Polekhina99].
In the cell, glutathione exists as reduced GST and oxidized GSSH forms. Most of the glutathione pool is kept in the reduced form. Excess L-cysteine is stored as glutathione because L-cysteine auto-oxidizes rapidly to L-cystine, producing potentially toxic oxygen radicals [Ritz01].

About this Pathway:
The synthesis of glutathione from its three amino acid precursors, L-glutamate, L-cysteine and glycine takes place in the cytosol. The pathway occurs in most tissues, but the liver is the predominant organ for glutathione biosynthesis in mammals.
GSH is synthesized in a two-step reaction, catalyzed by glutamate--cysteine ligase and glutathione synthase, requiring a total of two moles of ATP per mole of GSH. The first step is controlled by negative feedback from the end product, GSH. Feedback inhibition can be partially impeded by an excess of glutamate that blocks the regulatory site on the enzyme [Meister84, Meister83].",NA,

Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid that is synthesized in vertebrates. Creatine and its phosphorylated form N¦Ø-phosphocreatine act as a dynamic reservoir of high-energy phosphate. This reservoir maintains the ATP/ADP ratio and plays a pivotal role in the energy metabolism of muscle and nerve tissues [Walker79].

Creatine and N¦Ø-phosphocreatine are found predominantly in skeletal muscle, heart, spermatozoa and retinal photoreceptor cells. However, the major sites of creatine biosynthesis are kidney, pancreas and liver. Creatine is synthesized in these organs and transported through the blood stream to tissues with a high requirement for creatine [Ku80]. The majority of creatine in the tissues is phosphorylated in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by creatine kinase [EricksonViitane82].

About this Pathway

In humans, the main route of creatine biosynthesis involves guanidinoacetate formation in the kidney. Glycine is converted to creatine by amidino group transfer from L-arginine to glycine to form guanidinoacetate. This rate limiting step is catalyzed by glycine amidinotransferase [Humm97]. The guanidinoacetate is transported via the blood to the liver where it is methylated to creatine. This involves a methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to guanidinoacetate catalyzed by guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase [Stockler96].

Creatine is transported in the blood and taken up and concentrated in tissues that contain high creatine kinase activity, such as muscle and nerve tissue. Uptake occurs via sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter 1, a specific Na+-dependent creatine transporter system [Salomons01][Loike88].

Creatine is phosphorylated by creatine kinase to create a pool of N¦Ø-phosphocreatine. The N¦Ø-phosphocreatine pool stores energy for the replenishment of ATP during periods of high energy demand.

In vivo, creatine can undergo spontaneous, irreversible, nonenzymatic cyclization to creatinine, which is excreted in urine. In vitro however, this reaction is reversible in a pH and temperature-dependent manner [Wyss00].

Both of the enzymes involved in this pathway have been detected in a variety of tissues, and the relative contribution of other tissues to total creatine biosynthesis, as well as the significance of inter-tissue transport, remains to be defined [Wyss00].

Mutations in the genes for either of the two enzymes of this pathway or the sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter 1, result in autosomal recessive human disorders of creatine metabolism that are characterized by mental retardation, seizures and muscular hyptonia [Edvardson]. The severity of the diseases can be somewhat overcome by creatine supplementation [Ndika12].",NA,

The mitochondrial glycine cleavage complex is a loosely-associated multienzyme complex composed of four different proteins: P-protein, T-protein, L-protein and H-protein. The L-protein also participates in the pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl CoA, the 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation to succinyl-CoA, and the 2-oxoisovalerate decarboxylation to isobutanoyl-CoA multienzyme systems. The H-protein contains a prosthetic lipoyl group that interacts successively with the three other components of the complex during the enzymatic reactions. It transfers two electrons through the lipoyl moiety in the reversible reactions. In addition, H-protein serves as a regulatory protein [Kume91].

About this Pathway:
The glycine cleavage complex catalyzes the reversible oxidation of glycine to 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate, CO2 and ammonium, in a multistep reaction [Nakai05]. The methylene group, carried by 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate, enters cellular one-carbon metabolism. In mammals, it is the primary pathway for glycine catabolism [Hampson83]. It also provides a route for glycine biosynthesis. Glycine cleavage activity occurs predominantly in the brain, liver and kidney.
In humans, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia results from deficiency-causing mutations in the genes encoding P-protein or T-protein. This autosomal recessive metabolic disorder results in accumulation of glycine in body fluids, causing severe neurological symptoms [Kure06][OkamuraIkeda05].

The folates act as cofactors and ferry the one-carbon units between reactions.

About This Pathway:
The serine hydroxymethyltransferases (SHMT) are pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes that generate one-carbon units using the hydroxymethyl group of the amino acid serine as a substrate [MacFarlane08]. SHMT catalyzes the reversible conversion of L-serine and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate.
SHMT activity and incorporation of the ¦Â carbon of serine into DNA are increased during the S phase of the cell cycle and when cells are stimulated to proliferate [Snell87]. SHMT plays a key role in regulating DNA synthesis through the supply of folate which is a cofactor for dTMP biosynthesis [Fox09]. The human SHMT consists of two isozymes, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 and cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1.
It has been suggested that glycine synthesis from serine occurs in the mitochondria, while cytosolic SHMT catalyzes the conversion of glycine to serine. While the fact that mammalian cells lacking mitochondrial SHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine seems to indicate some validity for this hypothesis, direct evidence is lacking [Garrow93].",NA,

Heme (protoheme, heme b) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.

Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as protoheme, different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as heme o, heme a, heme c, and heme d.

This pathway describes the aerobic route for protoheme biosynthesis. This pathway involves the enzymes coproporphyrinogen III oxidase and protoporphyrinogen oxidase monomer, which require moelecular oxygen for their respective reactions.

There are several types of protoporphyrinogen oxidases: in most eukaryotes and many aerobic or facultative bacteria, such as Firmicutes, the enzyme is a FAD-dependent ~55 kDa protein encoded by the hemY gene. A number of ¦Ã-proteobacteria, including Escherichia coli, have another type of oxidase, a 21 kDa protein encoded by the hemG gene.

The amino acid L-cysteine has important roles in protein structure and function, including the catalytic activity of some enzymes. It is also a component of glutathione and a thioredoxin, which maintain a reducing environment inside the cell. In animals, cysteine derives its carbon and nitrogen from L-serine, and its sulfur from L-methionine [Griffith87].

About this Pathway

L-homocysteine is condensed with L-serine to form L-cystathionine in an irreversible reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme cystathionine ¦Â-synthase. The enzyme cystathionine ¦Ã-lyase then cleaves of the C-¦Ã-S bond of L-cystathionine, yielding L-cysteine, 2-oxobutanoate and ammonia in a transsulfuration reaction [Griffith87, Finkelstein90]. 2-oxobutanoate can be degraded further into TCA cycle intermediates in 2-oxobutanoate degradation.

This is part of superpathway of methionine degradation in mammals. Under normal metabolic conditions, essentially all of the sulfur derived from methionine degradation is transferred to cysteine before the sulfur atom is oxidized and excreted [Stipanuk04].",NA,

4-hydroxyproline residues contribute to the stability of the collagen triple helix. Collagen is a major constituent of extracellular matrix protein. Other proteins containing 4-hydroxyproline include elastin, the complement component C1q, and acetylcholinesterase. Most of the 4-hydroxyproline in animals is biosynthesized by post-translational modification of appropriate L-proline residues by prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 during the biosynthesis and maturation of collagen. The 4-hydroxyproline released during collagen degradation cannot be reutilized and is degraded instead.

About this Pathway

This major mammalian pathway for 4-hydroxyproline degradation has been demonstrated in liver and kidney mitochondria. All the enzymes in this pathway are expressed in human liver, kidney, pancreas and small intestine [Jiang12].

The first step of the pathway, the oxidation of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline to (3R,5S)-3-hydroxy-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate is an electron transfer reaction, very likely catalyzed by proline dehydrogenase 2, which like mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase 1 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The two distinct enzymes mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase 1 and proline dehydrogenase 2 catalyze the first step of L-proline degradation and trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline degradation respectively, and have little or no substrate crossover. However, the downstream metabolites of both pathways are degraded by a series of analogous reactions of biochemical similarity [Cooper08].

The substrate (3R,5S)-3-hydroxy-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate exists in spontaneous equilibrium with its open chain form L-4-hydroxyglutamate semialdehyde [Takayama03]. The second enzyme, ¦¤1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial, shared with L-proline degradation, catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of L-4-hydroxyglutamate semialdehyde to erythro-4-hydroxy-L-glutamate [Valle79, Adams60].

After the deamination step catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase 2, the hydroxyl group of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate permits an aldol cleavage to produce pyruvate and glyoxylate catalyzed by 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase [Riedel11].

Triacylglycerol (TAG) degradation is critical to many plants for which lipids rather than carbohydrates are the major seed storage reserves. The breakdown of the seed storage lipid provides carbon skeletons and energy that can drive postgerminative plant growth before the plant root system and photosynthetic capacity are fully established.

TAG degradation occurs in the seed oil body where TAG is deposited and stored. The liberated free fatty acids are transported to glyoxysomes where they are converted to acetyl-CoAs via the beta oxidation pathway ( fatty acid ¦Â-oxidation II (plant peroxisome)). The acetyl-CoAs are eventually converted to carbohydrates via glyoxylate cycle ( superpathway of glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation). It is generally thought that the hydrolytic attack of TAG primarily occurs at the sn-1 or sn-3 positions but not the sn-2 position. Sn-2 monoacylglycerols are naturally racemized to sn-1 monoacylglycerols to be completely hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipases (pg255 in [Dey97a]).

Despite the importance of the pathway for plants, there is still not much known about the plant enzymes and genes of the pathway, especially di- and mono-acylglycerol lipases. To date, only an Arabidopsis triacylglycerol lipase has been biochemically and genetically proven to play a role in the breakdown of seed storage TAG during seed germination.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the degradation of TAG and phospholipids is taking place in the lipid droplets [Czabany07, Henry12] where all the tri- to monoacylglycerol lipases of yeast have been shown to be located and enzymatically active [Athenstaedt99, Athenstaedt05]. The major TAG lipase TGL3p also exhibited DAG lipase activity in vitro [Kurat06]. The other TAG lipase of importance in yeast, i.e. TGL4 has even been demonstrated to represent a multi-functional enzyme which also acts as steryl ester hydrolase, sn-1 and sn-2 phospholipase A2 and acyl-CoA dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase [Rajakumari10]. In addition, the TAG lipase TGL5 has been found to be bifunctional and furthermore catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphilipids [Rajakumari10a] indicating that TAG lipase enzymes of yeast are likewise involved in catabolic and anabolic pathways of fatty acid metabolism.

In plants, at least four types of phospholipases have been reported including phospholipase A1 (PLA1), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C (PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). PLAs are directly implicated in the removal of unusual fatty acids from phospholipids for their integration into triacylglycerol. PLAs are also involved in plant signal transduction, such as responding to auxin stimulation of growth, pathogen and elicitor (reviewed in [Ryu04]).

PLCs hydrolyze phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, and are thus important in secondary messenger pathways [Otterhag01].

L-lysine is an essential amino acid in humans. It is required for protein synthesis, enzyme catalysis and L-carnitine biosynthesis. The first two steps of this lysine catabolic pathway mirror the terminal steps of lysine biosynthesis in lower eukaryotes. L-lysine is converted to L-saccharopine in the first step, and this pathway is also referred to as the saccharopine pathway. In higher eukaryotes, this mitochondrial pathway is the primary pathway for lysine catabolism in the developing brain and extracerebral tissues [Hallen13]. L-lysine may also be catabolized via L-pipecolate in the alternate L-lysine degradation (pipecolate pathway) in adult brain [Struys10]. The two pathways converge at the level of (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate which is in equilibrium with its cyclic ring form, 1-piperideine 6-carboxylate [Hallen13].

About this Pathway

The first two reactions are catalyzed by bifunctional ¦Á-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase which possesses both lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase activities [Sacksteder00]. The nitrogen atom of (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate is derived from the ¦Å amino group of L-lysine.

In the next step, (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate is converted to L-2-aminoadipate by ¦Á-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase [Mills06]. (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate is in spontaneous equilibrium with its cyclic form 1-piperideine 6-carboxylate; a molecule with a heterocyclic ring structure. Mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene and loss of ¦Á-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase causes accumulation of 1-piperideine 6-carboxylate which forms a Knoevenagel condensation with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, preventing it from being an enzyme cofactor [Struys12]. This is the cause of pyrdoxine dependent seizures in patients lacking ¦Á-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. The downstream reactions from (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate for this pathway and L-lysine degradation (pipecolate pathway) are the same.

Mitochondrial probable 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 component DHKTD1 is one of two known isoforms of the E1 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA within the TCA cycle [Reed01]. The probable 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 component DHKTD1 may mediate the decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA in the last step of this pathway [Danhauser12].",NA,

The rates of oxidation and reduction of NAD+ and NADH must be continuously balanced within the cell to maintain the pathways of anabolism and catabolism. NADH produced in the cytosol during glycolysis needs to be oxidized to NAD+ and the NADH oxidation process in the cell occurs primarily via mitochondrial respiration. NADH is the reducing equivalent that supplies electrons to the electron transport chain to generate ATP.

NADH cannot traverse the inner mitochondrial membrane and cytosolic reducing equivalents (hydrogen atoms) must be transferred to the mitochondria across the membrane via metabolite shuttles that operate between the two compartments [Tobin80]. The malate-aspartate shuttle is a biochemical entity that facilitates the translocation of electrons across the membrane.

The shuttle involves a reaction between NADH and an oxidized substrate in the cytosol, the reduced substrate is transported into the mitochondrion and subsequently reoxidized by the electron transfer chain. There are two well established shuttles for the transport of reducing equivalents described for vertebrates, the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle.

About this Pathway

The shuttle consists of six key component proteins, malate dehydrogenase 1, malate dehydrogenase 2, aspartate aminotransferase 1, aspartate aminotransferase 2, mitochondrial aspartate glutamate transporter 1 and mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate/malate transporter.

Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH and a proton from oxaloacetate to form (S)-malate [Grisham83]. Subsequently, mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate/malate transporter simultaneously imports malate into the mitochondrial matrix from the cytosol and exports 2-oxoglutarate from the matrix to the cytosol. Malate is then converted back to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase 2, NAD+ is reduced to NADH and a proton is released [Grisham83].

Oxaloacetate cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. It acquires an amino group from L-glutamate in a transamination reaction catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase 2, and is transformed to L-aspartate [DAniello05]. This also produces 2-oxoglutarate and both L-aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The transporter mitochondrial aspartate glutamate transporter 1 simultaneously transports glutamate from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix while exporting aspartate from the matrix to the cytosol [Palmieri01]. In the cytosol, oxaloacetate is regenerated by reversal of the same transamination reaction catalyzed here by aspartate aminotransferase 1.

This shuttle is reversible, so electrons from NADH are brought into the mitochondrion when the NADH/NAD+ ratio is higher in the cytosol than in the mitochondrial matrix. The malate-aspartate shuttle yields approximately 3 molecules of ATP per molecule of cytosolic NADH and is found in liver, heart and kidney [Voet04]. It is quantatively the most important shuttle for the reoxidation of cytosolic NADH in vertebrate tissues under aerobic conditions.

This pathway also describes aspartate biosynthesis and degradation.",NA,

Protein glycosylation is an important process found in all kingdoms of life. N-glycosylation is found in eukaryotes and archaea, and very rarely in bacteria. During this process certain oligosaccharides are attached to an asparagine residue in the polypeptide chain of the target protein. In eukaryotes, the nascent proteins that are synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes are translocated across the ER membrane where they acquire the initial carbohydrate chains on specific asparagine residues. These glycoproteins then proceed through the Golgi complex where their oligosaccharides are modified further.

N-linked glycosylation in eukaryotes can be divided into the following three stages:

(i): the initial synthesis of dolichol phosphate-linked precursor tetradecasaccharides [(glucosyl)3(mannosyl)9-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)2] and their transfer from the dolichol phosphate anchor to newly synthesized polypeptides, where they are attached to the asparagine residues in Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons. This process occurs on the luminal face of the ER (this pathway).

(ii): the trimming of these high-mannose structures by ¦Á-glucosidases and ¦Á-mannosidases, which occurs in the ER and Golgi complex (see pathway protein N-glycosylation processing phase (endoplasmic reticulum, yeast)).

(iii): the synthesis of branched oligosaccharide chains, carried out by Golgi glycosyltransferases (see pathway complex N-linked glycan biosynthesis (vertebrates)).

The structure of the tetradecasaccharide precursor is common to most eukaryotes - animals, plants, most fungi, and the protist Euglena gracilis use this tetradecasaccharide precursor, although other protists are konwn to differ in the composition of the precursor [Ivatt84, De85, Samuelson05]. The pathway for the biosynthesis of the precursor is highly conserved, even though later processing and elongation steps differ among different organisms.

While archaea use different oligosaccharides and use somewhat different dolichol carriers, the archaeal pathway is in general similar to the eukaryotic one, and there is even sequence similarity between some of the eukaryotic, bacterial and arachaeal glycosyltransferases involved in the process [Burda99] (see for example protein N-glycosylation (Methanococcus voltae)).

About This Pathway

The eukaryotic biosynthetic pathway begins with the phosphorylation of dolichol, followed by stepwise addition of sugar residues to form the product dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide. This pathway is of particular interest in humans, because defects in the glycosyltransferases involved lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation. The genetic analysis of this pathway in a model organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has helped to elucidate the molecular basis of these disorders (reviewed in [Aebi01]). However, the enzymes that participate in this pathway are found in all eukaryotes [Lannoo15].

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the polyisoprenol dolichol contains 14 to 18 isoprene units, with 15 or 16 as the predominant components ( [Jung73], and reviewed in [Burda99]). It is synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate produced by the mevalonate pathway (see trans, trans-farnesyl diphosphate biosynthesis and dolichol and dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis). Dolichol can be phosphorylated de novo to dolichyl phosphate by the CTP-mediated dolichol kinase, the product of gene SEC59 [Bernstein89, Heller92]. Dolichyl phosphate can also be regenerated by other reactions (reviewed in [Burda99]).

Dolichyl phosphate is the essential carrier lipid for glycosyl residues. Each of the glycosyl residues is added by a specific glycosyltransferase [Burda99a], (in [Samuelson05, Gao04]), reviewed in [Burda99, Helenius04]. The substrate specificity of these enzymes results in a highly ordered assembly of glycosyl residues [Burda99a]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Alg (Asparagine-linked glycosylation) mutants of the glycosyltransferases have been isolated and the accumulated dolichyl-diphospho-glycan intermediates analyzed. On the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, glycosyltransferase ALG7 adds phospho-N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol-P; ALG13 and ALG14 form a complex that adds N-acetylglucosamine [Bickel05, Gao05a, Chantret05]; ALG1 adds the first mannose residue; ALG2 adds the second and third mannose residues [OReilly06]; and ALG11 adds the fourth and fifth mannose residues [OReilly06], creating the (mannosyl)5-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)2-diphosphodolichol intermediate [Cipollo01], (reviewed in [Burda99]). There is evidence that ALG1, ALG2 and ALG11 are physically associated in oligomeric complexes, suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism [Gao04].

After the fifth mannose residue is added, the dolichol-diphospho-glycan is translocated (flipped) into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by a ""flippase"". It has been initially thought that the flippase is encoded by the RFT1 gene, but that has proven incorrect, and the identity of the flippase is still unknown. Mannosyltransferases in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, ALG3, ALG9, and ALG12 use dolichyl ¦Â-D-mannosyl phosphate, synthesized by the product of gene DPM1, as a sugar donor to add other mannose residues. Also in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, dolichyl ¦Â-D-glycosyl phosphate, synthesized by ALG5, is the sugar donor to add the three glucose residues via ALG6, ALG8, and ALG10 ( [Frank05] and reviewed in [Burda99]).

Note that the seven sugars added outside the ER are nucleoside-activated, while the seven sugars added inside the lumen are derived from individually charged and flipped phosphodolichol carriers.

This core lipid-linked oligosaccharide, (glucosyl)3(mannosyl)9-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)2-diphosphodolichol ( dolichyl diphosphooligosaccharide), is then transferred by the oligosaccharyl transferase complex (OST) to asparagine residues within the recognition sequence asparagine-x-threonine/serine (N-X-T/S) on nascent polypeptides [Karaoglu97, Karaoglu01]. During the transfer a dolichyl diphosphate is released in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is cleaved by a dolichyl diphosphate phosphatase to a dolichyl phosphate. Mechanisms for recycling of this dolichyl phosphate have been proposed [Rush08].

In higher eukaryotes, further processing of the glycosylated, nascent polypeptide by enzymatic glucose addition and removal serves as a quality control mechanism for improperly folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, although this mechanism appears to be modified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Jakob98]. Final glycosylation of properly folded proteins occurs in the Golgi (reviewed in [Herscovics93]). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of the alg genes may also have a role in regulation of the cell cycle (reviewed in [Kukuruzinska99]).",NA,

In mammals, L-methionine is an essential amino acid, it is not synthesized and must be obtained in the diet. Methionine is catabolized to L-homocysteine via S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). SAM is a compound that mediates most biological methylations.

About this Pathway

Methionine is first metabolized to SAM in a reaction catalyzed by S-adenosylmethionine synthase [Mato97]. In the second reaction, the methyl group is transferred to other acceptors in a transmethylation step. The product, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine is then hydrolyzed to L-homocysteine and adenosine [Hermes08].

Homocysteine is a branch point. In mammals, approximately half of the homocysteine formed is remethylated back to methionine via L-methionine salvage from L-homocysteine. The remaining homocysteine is degraded further in L-cysteine biosynthesis III (from L-homocysteine) [Griffith87][Finkelstein90].",NA,

Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via glycerone phosphate), fatty acid metabolism (via acetone), and protein metabolism (via aminoacetone). Methylglyoxal is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see [Kalapos99] for a review). There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds. These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.

About This Pathway

This pathway is different from the pathways methylglyoxal degradation IV and methylglyoxal degradation V in that (R)-lactaldehyde and (R)-lactate are involved, rather than the L-specific isomers.

Methylglyoxal reductase enzymes that are specific for the D-form of lactaldehyde have been purified from rat liver [TING65] and goat liver [Ray84]. Both enzymes were specific for NADH (although the goat liver enzyme would accept NADPH, resulting in lower activity). The rat enzyme was isolated as catalyzing the reverse reaction (the oxidation of D-lactaldehyde to methylglyoxal), but that reaction was shown to be reversible.

While the rest of this pathway has not been characterized well, the presence of the enzymes required to metabolize (R)-lactaldehyde to pyruvate via (R)-lactate in mammalian cells is well documented [Sladek03, deBari02]. Some literature suggests that (R)-propane-1,2-diol is also a product of (R)-lactaldehyde metabolism [TING64].",NA,

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate (NADP) are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell. Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions. Due to the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds are often depicted as NAD+ and NADP+, respectively [Lin03].

Most oxidative reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. In reactions where NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate. During the reduction of NAD+ (or NADP+) the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while the second proton is released into the medium. Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form: NAD+ + 2H -> NADH + H+

NAD+ also has myriad nonredox roles in the cell. It is a substrate in posttranslational covalent modifications of key proteins, such as mono- and poly-ADP ribosylation reactions. NAD+ homeostasis is related to the production of reactive oxygen species responsible for irreversible cellular damage in a number of diseases [Lu09]. It also plays a role in longevity and transcriptional silencing through the regulation of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), the human homolog of the S. cerevisiae SIR2 protein known to be involved in cell aging and response to DNA damage [Langley02].

NAD+ is synthesized via two major pathways in humans; the NAD de novo biosynthesis and NAD salvage pathways.

About this Pathway:
This pathway represents an NAD+ salvage pathway for the synthesis of NAD+. The key enzymes, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 recycle nicotinamide to generate NAD+. The enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to ¦Â-nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide [Khan06]. The enzyme localizes to both the cytosol and nucleus.

The pyridine nucleotide coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) play key roles as cofactors in oxidation-reduction reactions in all living cells. The nicotinamide ring functions as a prosthetic group for these reactions. Their oxidized forms are depicted here as NAD+ and NADP+ due to the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring. Their reduced forms are referred to as NADH and NADPH.

Although they appear chemically equivalent, their metabolic roles differ. NAD+ is generally the cofactor for energy-producing oxidation reactions, while NADPH is the cofactor for reductive biosynthetic reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative branch) is an important source of NADPH [Sauer04].

NAD kinase is a cytosolic enzyme which phosphorylates NAD+ to form NADP+ [Lerner01]. Its activity is regulated by the redox state of the cell and is inhibited by NADPH.

It consists of three subunits and is part of the energy-transfer system of the respiratory chain [White00]. The protein catalyzes the transfer of a hydride ion between NADH and NADP+ [Zieger97]. The transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled to respiration and ATP hydrolysis and functions as a proton pump across the membrane.

NAD+ is synthesised via two major pathways in humans; the NAD de novo biosynthesis and NAD salvage pathways.

About This Pathway:
In eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with L-tryptophan. The role of tryptophan as a precursor for eukaryotic NAD biosynthesis was first suggested by nutritional studies in which humans stricken with pellagra, a nicotinamide (niacin) deficiency disease, recovered after the addition of tryptophan or niacin to their diets [Krehl45]. Other studies established tryptophan as a precursor of NAD in many animal and plant systems [Foster80].

In the first and rate limiting step, L-tryptophan is oxidatively cleaved to N-formyl-L-kynurenine by the action of one of three enzymes, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2, depending upon the tissue. Thus this pathway also describes L-tryptophan degradation, see L-tryptophan degradation (kynurenine pathway).

Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via glycerone phosphate), fatty acid metabolism (via acetone), and protein metabolism (via aminoacetone). Methylglyoxal is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see [Kalapos99] for a review). There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds. These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.

About This Pathway

This pathway is different from the pathways methylglyoxal degradation IV and methylglyoxal degradation V in that (R)-lactaldehyde and (R)-lactate are involved, rather than the L-specific isomers.

Methylglyoxal reductase enzymes that are specific for the D-form of lactaldehyde have been purified from rat liver [TING65] and goat liver [Ray84]. Both enzymes were specific for NADH (although the goat liver enzyme would accept NADPH, resulting in lower activity). The rat enzyme was isolated as catalyzing the reverse reaction (the oxidation of D-lactaldehyde to methylglyoxal), but that reaction was shown to be reversible.

While the rest of this pathway has not been characterized well, the presence of the enzymes required to metabolize (R)-lactaldehyde to pyruvate via (R)-lactate in mammalian cells is well documented [Sladek03, deBari02]. Some literature suggests that (R)-propane-1,2-diol is also a product of (R)-lactaldehyde metabolism [TING64].",NA,

In humans, L-phenylalanine is an indispensable dietary amino acid which may be either be used directly for protein synthesis or converted to the amino acid L-tyrosine, the precursor for catecholamine and thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Tyrosine is not considered an indispensable dietary amino acid, despite being an essential component of body proteins, because it can be synthesized from phenylalanine [McGee72][Haggerty75].

About this Pathway:

Phenylalanine degradation and L-tyrosine biosynthesis involve one and the same pathway represented by the irreversible hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine, catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase. The enzyme is located in the cytosol and is expressed predominantly in the liver and kidney [Stanley85][Moller00].

The enzyme in its inactive form exists as a homodimer. Upon binding of phenylalanine to the regulatory domain which promotes phosphorylation of Ser 16, the enzyme aggregates as an active tetramer. The cofactor a tetrahydrobiopterin can then bind to the active site domain, initiating catalysis [Erlandsen00]. Tetrahydrobiopterin is regenerated from 4a-hydroxy-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin via a 7,8-dihydrobiopterin by the enzymes pterin-4¦Á-carbinolamine dehydratase and L-erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin reductase. Together these three enzymes form the phenylalanine hydroxylating system.

The phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme has been well characterized mechanistically and structurally in humans [Fitzpatrick03]. Formation of L-tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase can lead to L-tyrosine degradation or to the biosynthesis of catecholamines in catecholamine biosynthesis. A deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase in humans causes hyperphenylalanemia, characterized by phenylketonuria [Fusetti98].",NA,

Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is a pyridine compound that belongs to the ensemble of vitamin B6 compounds that include pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine [diSalvo11]. It is the active form of vitamin B6 in organisms and a prosthetic group of many enzymes involved in intermediary metabolism [Hanna97]. Only microorganisms and plants are able to synthesize it de novo. Mammals require the inactive dietary precursors pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, to synthesize PLP in a recycled salvage pathway. Mammalian liver serves a central role in vitamin B6 metabolism [Merrill84].

The aldehyde group of PLP forms a Schiff base with the ¦Å amino group of an active site lysine residue on the enzyme. This is displaced by the ¦Á amino group of the substrate which forms a new aldimine. This aldimine is the central intermediate for all PLP catalyzed reactions [Toney05].

About this Pathway:
The dietary precursors pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine are phosphorylated on their 5' alcohol group in an ATP-dependent reaction by pyridoxal kinase to form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate and pyridoxine 5'-phosphate respectively [Hanna97]. The pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate and pyridoxine 5'-phosphate are further oxidized to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate by pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase.

Dietary vitamin B6 includes the phosphorylated forms in meat and and pyridoxine glucosides in plants. In mammals, ingested phosphorylated vitamin B6 is first hydrolyzed to pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine by intestinal alkaline phosphatase, while pyridoxine glucosides are hydrolyzed by a glucosidase prior to absorption.

The absorbed vitamins are taken up by the liver, where they are phosphorylated and oxidized to PLP. PLP is released into into the circulation bound to a lysine residue of albumin and constitutes the major source of the cofactor in blood [Bohney92]. The circulating PLP must be dephosphorylated by membrane-associated phosphatases before gaining entry into target cells. After diffusing through cell membranes, it is rephosphorylated by intracellular pyridoxal kinase and oxidized by pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase to reform PLP. A PLP specific phosphatase, pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase is also present, with an essential role in cellular metabolism [Jang03].

Evidence for aberrant handling of vitamin B6 is particularly evident in patients with cirrhosis and other liver diseases. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy.",NA,

Propionyl CoA is a byproduct of several metabolic pathways such as branched chain amino acid degradation, odd numbered fatty acid degradation, cholesterol degradation and the degradation of other metabolites [Lamhonwah86]. This pathway describes the degradation of propanoyl-CoA, which feeds directly into the TCA cycle [Crane92].

About this Pathway:
This pathway occurs in the mitochondria. Biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase subsequently catalyzes the carboxylation of propanoyl-CoA to (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix [Lamhonwah87]. Mutations in either the PCCA or PCCB genes of propionyl-CoA carboxylase can cause propionic acidemia [Ugarte99]. Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase then catalyzes the transformation of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA [Montgomery83]. In humans, defects in the methylmalonyl CoA epimerase MCEE gene can cause methylmalonyl aciduria [Bikker06].Finally methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the isomerization of (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, in the last step of the pathway [Crane92]. Mutations in the MUT gene also gives rise to methylmalonic aciduria [Ledley90].",NA,

L-proline is a non-essential amino acid in that it can be synthesized in the body to meet amino acid requirements. The synthesis of proline in mammals begins with L-glutamate. This universal pathway is found in all living organisms, though L-glutamate may arise through different means depending on the organism. In mammals, L-glutamate is formed in the mitochondrial matrix by NAD(P)+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases.

About this Pathway:
The first two steps of the pathway are catalyzed by a single enzyme, bifunctional ¦Ä-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase which has both ¦Ã-glutamyl kinase and ¦Ã-glutamyl phosphate reductase activities [Aral96]. The enzyme first phosphorylates L-glutamate and then reduces the product ¦Ã-L-glutamyl 5-phosphate to form L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde. The latter compound spontaneously cyclizes to (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which in the last step is converted to L-proline by the universal housekeeping pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases [Dougherty92]. L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde can also be converted to L-ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase in ornithine de novo biosynthesis.

The entire pathway occurs within the mitochondria, but the last step may occur in the cytosol depending on which pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is used.",NA,

L-proline is not an essential amino acid, as it can be synthesized in the body from L-glutamate, see L-proline biosynthesis. Proline is important for protein synthesis, and as a source of glutamate can be a precursor for TCA cycle intermediates. It also participates in a metabolic cycle that shuttles redox equivalents between the mitochondria and cytosol [Cooper08]. However, high L-proline levels are detrimental to health and can cause seizures and mental retardation.

About this Pathway:
L-proline is catabolized to L-glutamate by the action of two enzymes, mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase 1 (proline oxidase) and ¦¤1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial in the mitochondrion [Bender05]. The product of mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase 1, (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate is in spontaneous equilibrium with its open form L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde [Srivastava12].

Polyamines (the most common of which are putrescine, spermidine and spermine), a group of positively charged small molecules present in virtually in all living organisms, have been implicated in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes [Tabor85, Abraham68, Frydman92, Huang90]. Although polyamines are clearly necessary for optimal cell growth, a surplus of polyamines can cause inhibition of growth and protein synthesis [He93], and thus a balance is desired between the production and breakdown of polyamines

Several metabolic pathways for the degradation of putrescine are known.

About This Pathway:
This pathway, which involves acetylated intermediates, was discovered in mammalian brain [Seiler74]; it starts with the acetylation of putrescine, followed by oxidative deamination, through 4-acetamidobutanal, to 4-acetamidobutanoate, and subsequent transformation to 4-aminobutanoate. 4-aminobutanoate is then fed to the GABA shunt (see GABA shunt), by which it is degraded to succinate, and transferred to the TCA cycle I (prokaryotic).

In contrast to putrescine, which is a substrate of diamine oxidase, N-acetylputrescine is deaminated by monoamine oxidase.",NA,"Background

The various folate coenzymes are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. They also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, and play a role in L-histidine degradation [Lucock00]. Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is highly compartmentalized in eukaryotes, with the relevant enzymes found in mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus [Appling91]. Carbon 3 of L-serine is the major one-carbon donor.Tetrahydrofolate is the parent structure of the family of folate coenzymes. The coenzymes differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions, and the number of glutamic acid moieties conjugated one to another via a series of ¦Ã-glutamyl links to form an oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl tail. There are numerous enzymes that convert the folates from one form to another, and the important ones are included in this pathway. Important folate coenzymes include the mono- and polyglutamylated forms of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate, (6S)-5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate.

About this Pathway

As humans are not able to synthesize folate in vivo, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate [Thien77]. During the absorption of food folates, which are usually polyglutamylated, the folate derivatives are hydrolyzed to a mono-glutamate level by the enzyme ¦Ã-glutamyl hydrolase see glutamate removal from folates, prior to transport. The monoglutamylated forms are then metabolized within the enterocyte to 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate [Herbert62, Lucock89].
Tetrahydrofolate is the form that can be used in biosynthetic pathways and can be charged with a one-carbon unit from L-serine, in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria via serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 or serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2. It is also the preferred substrate of folylpolyglutamate synthase, which conjugates glutamate moieties to generate oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl tetrahydrobiopterin [Green88]. The predominant product of this reaction is the hexaglutamyl-tetrahydrobiopterin form [Cook87].
In erythrocytes, folate is largely present in the forms of 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and (6S)-5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, mostly containing five or six glutamate residues [Lucock00a, Perry76]. However, the active forms of folate required for nucleotide synthesis are 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate. 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate is also required by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in the biosynthesis of methionine. Thus, 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate is at the branch point of three important pathways [Green88]. (6S)-5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate is converted to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate in an ATP-dependent reaction by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase [Bertrand87]."

Trehalose, also known as mycose or tremalose, is a natural ¦Á-linked disaccharide. It was first discovered in 1832, in an ergot of rye by H. A. L. Wiggers. It can be synthesised by bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrates. It has high water retention capabilities and is implicated in anhydrobiosis, the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation [SolaPenna98].

Trehalose is known to induce autophagy and may be useful in the treatment of Huntington's disease and Parkinson disease, where it may correct defects in autophagy and improve removal of aggregated proteins [Sarkar07]. In a mouse model of depression, oral trehalose showed antidepressant properties.

Trehalase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ¦Á,¦Á-trehalose to ¦Á-D-glucopyranose and ¦Â-D-glucopyranose. It is a glycoprotein of brush-border membranes and is anchored to plasma membranes via glycosylphosphatidylinositol [Ishihara97].

Biotin-dependent carboxylases constitute a group of enzymes with many common features in structure and mechanism [Wood77]. These enzymes have been identified in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Some members of this family include EC 6.4.1.2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, EC 6.4.1.3, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, EC 6.4.1.4, methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase, EC 6.4.1.5, geranoyl-CoA carboxylase, EC 6.4.1.7, 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase, EC 2.1.3.1, methylmalonyl-CoA carboxytransferase, EC 6.3.4.6, urea carboxylase, and EC 6.4.1.1, pyruvate carboxylase. These enzymes are involved in various metabolic reactions such as lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism. Another group of bioin-dependent enzymes are the decarboxylases mediating sodium transport [Samols88] (for an example, see biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase from Malonomonas rubra).

The different biotin-dependent enzymes have different architectures in different organisms. For example, eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylases ( EC 6.4.1.2) contain three functional modules in one large polypeptide (biotin carboxylase/biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein/carboxyltransferase), eukaryotic propionyl-CoA-carboxylases and bifunctional acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylases of Mycobacteria are composed of a coupled biotin carboxylase/biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein polypeptide and separate carboxyltransferase proteins, while all the subunits of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase exist as single proteins ( acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase, biotin carboxylase, and biotin carboxyl carrier protein) [Toh93, Norman94, Jager96].

About This Pathway

The enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex is one of the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (see superpathway of fatty acid biosynthesis initiation). In Escherichia coli the enzyme exists as a complex composed of two catalytic units and one carrier protein, encoded by four different genes. The catalytic units are biotin carboxylase (BC), a homodimer encoded by the accC gene, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (ACCT), an ¦Á2¦Â2 tetramer, encoded by the accA and accD genes. The carrier protein is the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), a homodimer encoded by the accB gene.

The BCCP monomer is biotinylated by the enzyme EC 6.3.4.15, biotin¡ª[biotin carboxyl-carrier protein] ligase. Following dimerization of the biotinylated monomers, EC 6.3.4.14, biotin carboxylase, catalyzes the carboxylation by hydrogencarbonate of the biotin molecules, forming a carboxybiotinylated BCCP. This form of the carrier protein in turn is the substrate for EC 6.4.1.2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which transfers the carboxy group to acetyl-CoA, resulting in the formation of malonyl-CoA and the regeneration of biotinylated BCCP dimer. Both biotinylation and carboxylation of the carrier protein require ATP, while the last step, transfer of the carboxy group to acetyl-CoA, does not [Barber05].

It should be noted that eukaryotes have a large single polypeptide ( EC 6.4.1.2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase) that includes the carrier protein, the biotin carboxylase, and the acetyl-CoA carboxytransferase activities, and thus calayzes the following transformation as a single reaction:

The predominant circulating pyrimidine in humans is uridine [Wu94, Cansev06]. In humans, the plasma level is strictly maintained at 3-5¦ÌM, a concentration higher than that of other nucleosides [Traut94]. Uridine, produced de novo in the liver and kidney, is circulated to other organs, where it serves as an important precursor in pyrimidine salvage pathways [Shambaugh79, Karle84, Moyer85, a, Barsotti02].

Cells maintain uridine concentration by balancing its input, its salvage, and its catabolism. The main enzyme responsible for uridine catabolism is uridine phosphorylase 1 and uridine phosphorylase 2.

About This Pathway:
Uridine phosphorylase breaks down uridine to the free base uracil and ¦Á-D-ribose-1-phosphate. Uracil is catabolized to ¦Â-alanine in a process considered to be restricted to the liver, see uracil degradation I (reductive) [REICHARD58, Connolly99, Loffler05]. Simultaneously, ¦Á-D-ribose-1-phosphate is converted to PRPP, which is used in the salvage synthesis of purine nucleotides [Wice82, Inoue]. Since the phosphorylase is not capable of cleaving cytidine, this nucleoside must be deaminated to uridine before it can be used by the cell. While the overall metabolic outcome of this pathway, the conversion of cytidine to uracil, is equivalent to pyrimidine salvage, this pathway is known to function as a catabolic pathway.

Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates dCTP and dTTP are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates CTP and UTP are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as UDP-¦Á-D-glucose, CMP-3-deoxy-¦Â-D-manno-octulosonate and dTDP-¦Á-D-fucopyranose, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids [Zhou98a, Giermann02, Schroder05, Zrenner06].

In addition to de novo biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the de novo biosynthesis pathways (see pyrimidine ribonucleosides salvage I, pyrimidine nucleobases salvage I and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides salvage). The de novo biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the de novo biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the de novo pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level. These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

The pyrimidine nucleotide de novo biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors oxaloacetate and D-ribose 5-phosphate. L-aspartate, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the TCA cycle.

About This Pathway

The de novo biosynthesis of UMP appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. The pathway converts hydrogencarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-¦Á-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to UMP (UMP), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides.

The enzyme UMP kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP. The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named UMP/CMP kinase [Okada04].

The penultimate enzyme in this pathway, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the terminal phosphate of a nucleoside triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside diphosphate - in this case, the transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP.

Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleotides is possible only at the level of nucleoside triphosphates, by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependent enzyme CTP synthetase.",NA,

Lipoate is an organosulfur compound derived from octanoate, that contains a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide. Lipoic acid is an essential prosthetic group of four mitochondrial enzymes involved in oxidative decarboxylation, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the branched-chain ¦Á-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the glycine cleavage complex [Mayr11].

Each of these enzyme complexes are composed of multiple copies of three enzymes: a substrate-specific decarboxylase-dehydrogenase E1, a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase E2 specific for each type of complex, and a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase E3. Lipoate is bound via an amide bond to the ¦Å-amino group of a strictly conserved lysine of the respective E2 subunits. The E3 subunit binding protein of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which resembles the E2 subunit, is also lipoylated. Similarly, lipoate acts as a prosthetic group of the H protein of the glycine cleavage complex [Reed93].

E1 catalyzes a reaction in which the substrate is attached to the lipoate cofactor and decarboxylated. During this reaction, the lipoate cofactor is reduced to dihydriolipoate. E2 then catalyzes an acyl transfer step, in which the product of the reaction is released. Finally, E3 catalyzes the oxidation of the dihydrolipoyl cofactor back to lipoyl form, with NAD+ being the ultimate electron acceptor [Reed90].

Lipoate is a universally conserved cofactor across all kingdoms of life. In mammals lipoate is biosynthesized de novo in the mitochondrial matrix from octanoyl-acyl carrier protein (octanoyl-ACP) which is produced during fatty acid biosynthesis. Although lipoate biosynthesis has been extensively studied in yeast and bacteria (see pathways lipoate biosynthesis and incorporation IV (yeast), lipoate biosynthesis and incorporation II and lipoate biosynthesis and incorporation III (Bacillus)), the process in mammals is not completely characterized (reviewed in [Mayr14, Tort16]). A basic scheme applicable to mammals is shown here.

About This Pathway

The synthesis of lipoate occurs in the mitochondrion. Initially, the starting substrate octanoyl-ACP is synthesized by mitochondrial fatty acid synthase in a series of reactions [Mayr11]. Lipoate synthesis begins with the transfer of the octanoyl moiety of an octanoyl-ACP to a conserved lysine residue of a lipoyl carrier protein, such as the H protein of the glycine cleavage complex (see pathway glycine cleavage). This reaction is catalyzed by the octanoyltransferase product of human gene LIPT2 (homologs LIP2 in yeast and LipB in Escherichia coli).

The octanoyl moiety is then sulfurated at carbons 6 and 8 by the lipoyl synthase product of human gene LIAS (homologs LIP5 in yeast, and LipA in E. coli). It catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain to an active lipoyl, generating a fully active lipoylated domain. The enzyme contains iron-sulfur clusters and human iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis genes GLRX5, ISCA2, IBA57, NFU1 and BOLA3 are associated with defects in lipoate biosynthesis (reviewed in [Mayr14, Tort16]). The reaction mechanism of this radical SAM superfamily enzyme has been studied in the E. coli homolog (see LipA).

While mammalian cells are capable of synthesizing (R)-lipoate in mitochondria, this pathway has not been completely elucidated in humans. It is generally believed that humans require some exogenous lipoate as a dietary supplement and rely on lipoate salvage to meet lipoate requirements [Morikawa01].

Human mutant studies suggest that the lipoyl moiety of lipoyl-H protein is transferred to conserved lysine residues in other lipoylated proteins such as the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes via the lipoate protein ligase product of gene LIPT1 (homolog LIP3 in yeast) [Tort14, Hermes13, Schonauer09, Habarou17].",NA,

About this Pathway

The enzyme lipoyltransferase 1 attaches pre-existing lipoate to an E2 enzyme, thus catalyzing a salvage pathway [Morris95]. The pathway has been shown to occur in animals [Fujiwara99, Fujiwara01].

It is generally believed that mammals primarily rely on salvaged (R)-lipoate although mammalian cells are capable of synthesizing (R)-lipoate in mitochondria [Morikawa01] (see pathway lipoate biosynthesis and incorporation). The ligation of salvaged (R)-lipoate in mammals is performed by a single enzyme, lipoyltransferase 1, which catalyzes both the activation of (R)-lipoate to a [(R)-lipoyl]adenylate intermediate, and the ligation of the latter to the E2 subunits [Fujiwara99, Fujiwara01].

Analysis of human mutations in LIPT1 indicates a specific defect in lipoylation of the E2 subunits of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, but not the glycine cleavage complex [Tort14, Soreze13] and reviewed in [Tort16, Mayr14].

Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. Folates are essential for DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. Humans cannot synthesize folates de novo, and require vitamin B9 (folic acid) as a regular dietary supplement to meet folate demands. The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase reduces 7,8-dihydrofolate monoglutamate, a derivative of vitamin B9, to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate.

Tetrahydrofolate can be converted to several other folate molecules [Sun01]. More commonly, folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates. The glutamates are often added by¦Ã-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the ¦Ã-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not normal amide bonds, they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases that are specific for ¦Á-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs to tetrahydrofolate and its derivatives. The glutamylation of folate residues has several goals, it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis. In mammals, it also allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, where it is required for glycine synthesis [Moran99].

About this Pathway

The bifunctional enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthase catalyzes the conversion of folates to polyglutamates. It is a Mg2+ATP-dependent enzyme ubiquitiously expressed. The enzyme forms a complex with Mg2+ATP, a folate derivative and glutamate, in an ordered manner whereby the three substrates are added sequentially [Sun01]. Folylpolyglutamate synthetase can accept several different folate derivatives as substrates. It seems that the preferred substrate for the addition of a second glutamate residue is 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, while the preferred substrate for the addition of a third glutamate residue is the glutamated form of 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate.

Folylpolyglutamates are generally better substrates for folate-dependent enzymes than their monoglutamyl counterparts. Km values decrease with increasing oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl chain length [Shane89]. The vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase has a requirement for the polyglutamate cofactor [Banerjee90].

Many folate enzymes are multifunctional and channel one-carbon units between reactions without achieving equilibrium with the cell medium. Therefore, the conjugated oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl chain can potentially regulate the reaction rates, and allows channeling of the substrate between enzymes in a way which controls biosynthetic pathways [Shane89].",NA,

The various folate coenzymes are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. They also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, and play a role in L-histidine degradation [Lucock00]. Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is highly compartmentalized in eukaryotes, with the relevant enzymes found in mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus [Appling91]. Carbon 3 of L-serine is the major one-carbon donor.

Tetrahydrofolate is the parent structure of the family of folate coenzymes. The coenzymes differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions, and the number of glutamic acid moieties conjugated one to another via a series of ¦Ã-glutamyl links to form an oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl tail. There are numerous enzymes that convert the folates from one form to another, and the important ones are included in this pathway. Important folate coenzymes include the mono- and polyglutamylated forms of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate, (6S)-5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate.

About this Pathway

As humans are not able to synthesize folate in vivo, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate [Thien77]. During the absorption of food folates, which are usually polyglutamylated, the folate derivatives are hydrolyzed to a mono-glutamate level by the enzyme ¦Ã-glutamyl hydrolase see glutamate removal from folates, prior to transport. The monoglutamylated forms are then metabolized within the enterocyte to 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate [Herbert62, Lucock89].

Tetrahydrofolate is the form that can be used in biosynthetic pathways and can be charged with a one-carbon unit from L-serine, in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria via serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 or serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2. It is also the preferred substrate of folylpolyglutamate synthase, which conjugates glutamate moieties to generate oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl tetrahydrobiopterin [Green88]. The predominant product of this reaction is the hexaglutamyl-tetrahydrobiopterin form [Cook87].

In erythrocytes, folate is largely present in the forms of 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and (6S)-5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate, mostly containing five or six glutamate residues [Lucock00a, Perry76]. However, the active forms of folate required for nucleotide synthesis are 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate. 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate is also required by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in the biosynthesis of methionine. Thus, 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate is at the branch point of three important pathways [Green88]. (6S)-5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate is converted to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate in an ATP-dependent reaction by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase [Bertrand87].",NA,

Inositol is a six carbon cyclitol abundantly distributed throughout biological systems. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers and myo-inositol is physiologically the most important stereoisomer. It is the precursor of all inositol-containing compounds including phosphoinositides, inositol phosphates, and membrane phospholipids [Lohia99].

The inositol-containing metabolites participate in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway and convey signals for a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters. Their metabolism plays a vital role in growth regulation, transcription regulation, membrane biogenesis, and other essential biochemical processes [Ju04].

Inositol metabolism is implicated in the etiology and treatment of bipolar disorder, a debilitating psychiatric illness [Bone92]. Lithium and valproate are two FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of bipolar disorder.

About this Pathway

The first and rate limiting step of the pathway is catalyzed by inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1, the NAD+ dependent conversion of D-glucose 6-phosphate to 1D-myo-inositol 3-monophosphate [Ju04].

Glycine betaine plays an important osmoprotectant role in mammals, protects from several other forms of cellular stress and functions as a methyl group donor [Lever10]. In mammals, glycine betaine is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation [Mehedint10][Zeisel12]. It is synthesized from choline in the choline degradation pathway [Salvi13]. The catabolism of glycine betaine is a continuation of choline degradation [Binzak01].

About this Pathway:
The catabolism of glycine betaine in this pathway involves the transfer of one-carbon units at the level of active formaldehyde [Binzak01]. The first reaction catalyzed by betaine--homocysteine S-methyltransferase occurs in the cytosol and involves the conversion of glycine betaine to N,N-dimethylglycine [Garrow96].
The next two steps of the pathway occur in the mitochondria. One methyl group is removed from N,N-dimethylglycine to form the modified amino acid sarcosine by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase [Binzak01]. A second methyl group is then removed from sarcosine to form glycine by sarcosine dehydrogenase [Binzak01]. Both enzymes are associated with 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate as a coenzyme, which receives the methyl group from formaldehyde and forms 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate or ""active formaldehyde"" [Binzak00]. In the absence of folate, formaldehyde and formate are produced [Steenkamp82]. Formaldehyde is oxidized to formate in formaldehyde oxidation II (glutathione-dependent).
In the last step of the pathway, ""active formaldehyde"" donates a methyl group to glycine to form L-serine via the serine hydroxymethyltransferases [Stover97]. Through the requirement for 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate as a cofactor for several of the reactions, this pathway is closely connected to folate transformations I.",NA,

Pyrimidines can be catabolized through two different pathways, thymine degradation and uracil degradation I (reductive) using the same enzymes but with different products.

About This Pathway:
The reductive pathway of uracil is essentially the same in bacteria and mammalian tissues [FINK52, FRITZSON57]. The product of the pathway, ¦Â-alanine, is a central component of (R)-pantothenate and ¦Ã-butyrobetaine biosynthesis, and also functions as a neurotransmitter in mammals [Sandberg81]. It is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of carnosine and anserine [Matthews87]. The pyrimidine degradation pathway is considered the main route for ¦Â-alanine biosynthesis in mammals [Van04].

The pathway proceeds in three sequential enzymatic steps. The first enzyme is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)], catalyzes the reversible reduction of uracil to 5,6-dihydrouracil [Van04]. The second enzyme, dihydropyrimidinase mediates the reversible hydrolytic ring-opening of 5,6-dihydrouracil to 3-ureidopropanoate [Hamajima98]. Finally, ¦Â-ureidopropionase catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of 3-ureidopropanoate to ¦Â-alanine in a reaction that produces ammonia and CO2 [Sakamoto01a].

Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.

S1P has been shown to activate an extracellular signaling pathway mediated through a family of specific G protein-coupled receptors. However, evidence indicates that S1P also mediates effects through a receptor-independent mechanism by functioning as a second messenger within cells.

Ceramides belong to a diverse class of lipids called sphingolipids that have important biological properties and control many aspects of cellular metabolism [Mullen12]. They are composed of a sphingoid base linked to a fatty acid via an amide bond. Ceramides make up a large percentage of the cell membrane and are the major lipid constituent of lamellar sheets in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum [Coderch03]. These lamellar sheets provide the barrier property of the epidermis.

Besides having structural properties, ceramides can act as a second messengers in the sphingomyelin cycle [Hannun94], and also play a role in cell aging, apoptosis and differentiation [Hannun00]. There are three major pathways for ceramide generation. This pathway describes de novo biosynthesis.

About this Pathway

The defining step in the de novo biosynthesis of ceramides is the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with L-serine catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase [Weiss97]. The resultant 3-dehydrosphinganine is immediately reduced to sphinganine in an NADPH dependent reaction catalyzed by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase. Dihydroceramide synthase catalyzes the acylation of sphinganine to yield a dihydroceramide, followed by a desaturation at the 4,5 position to form a ceramide [Michel97].

The last two steps of the pathway were decided by the discovery of the fungal secondary metabolite fumonisin B1 [Merrill96]. Fumonisin B1 is a potent inhibitor of the N-acylation of sphingoid bases and blocks the pathway at the dihydroceramide synthase step. This clarified that the latter part of the pathway proceeds first by acylation and then desaturation instead of vice versa [Wang91]. The pathway occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum.",NA,

A phosphatidylcholine is a phosphoglyceride composed of a glycerol backbone esterified to phosphocholine and two fatty acids. Phosphatidylcholine is a major component of eukaryotic cell membranes, in which it accounts for 40-60% of total phospholipids. It is also found in an estimated 10-15% of bacterial taxa, and especially in bacterial symbionts and pathogens of eukaryotes.

Phosphatidylcholine is often referred to by the name lecithin, obtained from ancient Greek for egg yolk (lekithos), from which it was originally isolated. There are two variations of the molecular structure, since either an end carbon or a middle carbon of the glycerol can be attached to the phosphocholine.

The phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathways vary among different organisms, and many variants have been described (see Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis). At least four alternative routes have been reported from plants, and additional routes were reported from animals, yeast and bacteria.

About This Pathway:
This variant is the predominant mechanism by which mammalian cells synthesize phosphatidylcholine. The pathway was first described by Eugene Kennedy in 1956, and is known, together with the parallel phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway, as the Kennedy Pathway [Kennedy56].

The pathway depends on choline kinase and on the availability of choline. Animals obtain choline, an essential nutrient, primarily from the diet. They can also produce choline by conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine followed by catabolism of phosphatidylcholine to choline (see pathway phospholipases) (reviewed in [Li08]).

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also utilizes the pathway shown here, although the methylation pathway shown in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis V is its primary pathway. When yeast use the pathway shown here, they obtain choline either by active transport of exogenous choline or by turnover of phosphatidylcholine (reviewed in [Boumann05, deKroon07]).

It is generally accepted that plants produce phosphatidylcholine via a mixed CDP-choline and methylation pathway (see pathway superpathway of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis) [Tasseva04]. Choline kinase activity has been reported from a number of plants such as Arabidopsis [Tasseva04], soybean [Monks96] and castor bean [Bligny89]. In Arabidopsis, this pathway is significant when the plants are under salt stress [Bligny89].

In addition, this pathway has been identified in the bacterium Treponema denticola, in which phosphatidylcholine makes up to 30% of the total membrane phospholipids [Livermore74, Kent04].",NA,

The polyamines, putrescine, spermidine,and spermine, are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes [Abraham68, Frydman92]. They play an essential role in the proliferation and development of mammalian cells. Abnormal polyamine metabolism may play a role in carcinogenesis [Pegg88]. Depletion of polyamines inhibits the growth of tumor cells.

Putrescine and spermidine are found in all life forms, and spermine is found mostly in eukaryotes. The metabolism of agmatine has long been known in bacteria, plants and invertebrates [Tabor84]. However, it was not until 1994 that agmatine synthesis in mammals was demonstrated.

About this Pathway:
Agmatine is synthesized from L-arginine by arginine decarboxylase [Zhu04]. Agmatine is then hydrolyzed by agmatinase to form urea and putrescine [Mistry02]. This provides an alternative route for polyamine biosynthesis to the better known putrescine biosynthesis III catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase [Almrud00]. Putrescine can serve as a polyamine on its own, or as a precursor for spermidine.

As Agmatine itself is biologically active, this pathway may not only provide a route for putrescine synthesis but may also represent a mechanism for regulating cell signaling via changes in agmatine levels. Agmatine can inhibit cell proliferation, stimulate glomerular filtration rate, affect nitric oxide synthase activities, and inhibit monoamine oxidase [Mistry02].",NA,

Thiols play several major roles in the cell; they help maintain protein sulfhydryl groups in a reduced state, fight reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, are involved in the detoxification of foreign compounds and act as an enzyme cofactor and amino acid transport [Uhlig92][Sekura74]. In most eukaryotes, the major thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (¦Ã-Glu-Cys-Gly). Its abundance, relatively low redox potential and high stability conferred by the unusual peptidase-resistant ¦Ã-glutamyl bond, are three of the properties that make glutathione an important cellular redox buffer.
Low glutathione levels have been associated with the pathology of several diseases including ulcerative colitis, type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease [Polekhina99].
In the cell, glutathione exists as reduced GST and oxidized GSSH forms. Most of the glutathione pool is kept in the reduced form. Excess L-cysteine is stored as glutathione because L-cysteine auto-oxidizes rapidly to L-cystine, producing potentially toxic oxygen radicals [Ritz01].

About This Pathway:
In mammals, the intracellular glutathione biosynthesis and utilization are linked by the ¦Ã-glutamyl cycle, which is composed of six enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The first two reactions are responsible for glutathione biosynthesis. An amide linkage is formed between L-cysteine and L-glutamate in the first step catalyzed by glutamate--cysteine ligase [Misra98]. Next, glutathione synthase catalyzes the reaction between glycine and the cysteine carboxyl of the ¦Ã-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine dipeptide to form glutathione [Polekhina99].
The second part of the pathway consists of glutathione degradation. The enzymes that catalyze the breakdown are membrane bound ¦Ã-glutamyltransferase 1 and cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase [Sakamuro88][Kaur09]. ¦Ã-glutamyltransferase 1 is one of several closely related isoforms that can remove the ¦Ã-glutamyl moiety from glutathione under physiological conditions, while cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase removes the glycyl moiety. The breakdown products, glutamate, glycine,and cysteine can be reabsorbed into the cell and reused in another round of the cycle [Meister76, Wang98e].",NA,

In the first reaction, R may be an aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic group, and X may be a sulfate, nitrile or halide group.

General Background

Thiols play several major roles in the cell; they help maintain the redox balance, keeping a reduced environment (see the pathway glutathione-glutaredoxin redox reactions), they fight reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and NOS, respectively), and they are involved in the detoxification of many other toxins and stress-inducing factors.

In most organisms the major thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (¦Ã-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as GSH). GSH is active against toxins by a process that involves multiple enzymes, and in the case of eukaryotes, occurs across multiple organs.

About This Pathway

In this important detoxification mechanism GSH binds to electrophilic chemicals, forming conjugates which are exported from the cell. These conjugation reactions have been demonstrated for a multitude of foreign chemicals, as well as endogenous reactive intermediates. GSH has been shown to form thioether conjugates with leukotrienes, a prostaglandin, hepoxilin, nitric oxide, hydroxyalkenals, L-ascorbate, L-dopa, dopamine, and maleate, and it forms thioesters with L-cysteine, coenzyme A, proteins, and other cellular thiols [Wang98a]. In addition, GSH also binds endogenous metals, such as copper, selenium, chromium, and zinc, via nonenzymatic reactions.

The first step is catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase, a family of enzymes found mainly in the cytosol. Once formed, the GSH-toxin conjugates are metabolized by the same degradative enzymes that metabolize GSH (see ¦Ã-glutamyl cycle). The GSH-toxin conjugate is transported out of the cell, where it is subsequently degraded by ¦Ã-glutamyl hydrolase or ¦Ã-glutamyl transpeptidase, and dipeptidases. The breakdown products of the GSH-toxin conjugates (glutamate and glycine) are reabsorbed and can be used for GSH synthesis. The an L-cysteine-S-conjugate that is left is also transported back into the cell, where it can be metabolized in different ways.

One route is the acetylation of the amino group of the cysteinyl residue by intracellular N-acetyltransferases to form the corresponding mercapturic acids (N-acetylcysteine S-conjugates). The addition of the N-acetylcysteine moiety generally increases the compound's polarity and water solubility, and converts neutral compounds to anions, facilitating their transport across cell membranes and their excretion from the organism [Boyland69]. Mercapturic acids are released into the circulation or bile [Hinchman91]; some are eventually excreted in urine, and some may undergo further metabolism.

A second route for an L-cysteine-S-conjugate is the breakage of the carbon-sulfur bond, catalyzed by cysteine-S-conjugate ¦Â-lyase resulting in the formation of thiols, pyruvate and ammonia [Larsen85, Vuilleumier97, Cooper05]. This enzymatic activity has been shown in both eukaryotes [Seta67] and prokaryotes [Yoshida02]. The thiols which are produced in this reaction are most likely oxidized to sulfonates, or methylated to methylsulfinyl or methylsulfonyl derivatives.

Yet additional fates for an L-cysteine-S-conjugate are possible. It has been shown that these compounds can be substrates for other enzymes, including aminotransferase and L-amino acid oxidase [Cooper05].

While this pathway has been studied in detail in eukaryotes, considerably less in known about bacteria. Recent sequencing projects of bacterial genomes have revealed the presence of numerous glutathione S-transferase genes in many microbes [Vuilleumier97, Vuilleumier02]. Biochemical evidence for the activity of such enzymes is also abundant. It seems that bacteria are more likely to continue by the cysteine conjugate lyase route, as there are several reports for this activity in bacteria [Larsen85, Yoshida02].",NA,

Glutathione (GSH) is a thiol that plays several major roles in the cell, including maintenance of the redox balance, fighting reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and the detoxification of many other toxins and stress-inducing factors, see glutathione-mediated detoxification I. In most organisms the tripeptide glutathione is synthesized de novo, see glutathione biosynthesis.

One of the main roles of glutathione in the cell is the reduction of other molecules, such as peroxides or protein-disulfide groups. In the course of its functions, it constantly shuttles between the reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione disulfide forms. Most of the glutathione pool is kept in its reduced form which is required for GSH functionality.

About This Pathway

In this pathway two molecules of glutathione are condensed into a single molecule of glutathione disulfide. In eukaryotes this oxidation reaction is often catalyzed by enzymes belonging to the glutathione peroxidase family. The glutathione disulfide is reduced back to GSH by the action of glutathione reductase. The protein thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12 also possesses glutathione reductase activity [Alanen03]. Another redox cycle involving glutaredoxin-1 and glutathione is described in glutathione-glutaredoxin redox reactions.",NA,

Each of these can be utilized by bacteria as a total source of carbon and energy.

Sorbitol is one of several acyclic polyols or sugar alcohols found in higher plants [Bieleski82]. In Rosaceae plants, sorbitol is the main photoassimilate produced in the leaves from which it is translocated to sink tissues [Webb62, Bieleski85]. Sorbitol synthesis shares a common hexose phosphate pool with sucrose synthesis, and it was recently shown in apple that synthesis pathways are not independent from one another [Zhou02a] as sucrose-phosphate synthase was shown to be inhibited by D-sorbitol 6-phosphate, an intermediate in sorbitol biosynthesis.

D-sorbitol degradation is common in prokaryotes. For example, Bacillus subtilis can utilize it as a sole carbon source via the gut operon (glucitol-utilizing transporter), consisting of a transporter and an NAD+-dependent glucitol dehydrogenase [Gay83, Watanabe03].

The pathway also occurs in plants, as translocated sorbitol is 'unloaded' in fruit tissues and eventually converted to fructose. In plants that use sorbitol as the main product of photosynthesis D-sorbitol dehydrogenase is a key enzyme, supplying carbon during fruit development.",NA,

Glycerol uptake in bacteria is mediated by the glycerol diffusion facilitator, an integral membrane protein catalyzing the rapid equilibration of concentration gradients of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane [Beijer93]. Intracellular glycerol is converted to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses ATP as phosphoryl donor. Glycerol-3-P is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator and thus remains in the cell, where it is further metabolized. As a result, the driving force for the uptake of glycerol is generated by the phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase [Charrier97].
While sn-glycerol 3-phosphate can not leave the cytoplasm, it can be imported into the cell by the GlpT transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, that couples the import of glycerol-3-P into the cytoplasm to the export of inorganic phosphates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm [Ambudkar86, Huang03].
In Escherichia coli sn-glycerol 3-phosphate can be further metabolized to glycerone phosphate by either of two membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (encoded by the glpD gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the electron acceptor [Schryvers78]. Under anaerobic conditions, a different glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase is preferentially expressed. This tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the glpACB operon, channels the electrons from sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to either fumarate or nitrate [Cole88].",NA,

The biosynthesis of several important metabolites involves the consumption of L-methionine through the utilization of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), in a reaction that releases S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA). These metabilites include polyamines (see spermine biosynthesis, spermidine biosynthesis I and aminopropylcadaverine biosynthesis), ethene (see ethene biosynthesis I (plants)), and bacterial auto-inducers (see autoinducer AI-1 biosynthesis).

MTA is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration is tightly regulated. Several pathways that recycle MTA back to L-methionine have been described.

The pathway shown here, also known as the universal methionine salvage pathway, is present with some variations in almost all eukaryotes and some bacteria [Albers09]. It has been partially characterized from a number of organisms, including bacteria [Myers93, Wray95, Cornell96a, Dai99a, Dai01], plants [Baur72, Murr75, Kushad83, Miyazaki87], yeast [Marchitto85], protozoal parasites [Sufrin95, Berger01a] and rat [Backlund81, Backlund82, Wray95]. The pathway was best studied in the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae.

A limiting factor to the distribution of this pathway is that it contains an oxygen-requiring step ( EC 1.13.11.54, acireductone dioxygenase [iron(II)-requiring]), and is thus present only in aerobic organisms. Alternative pathways exist in anaerobic organisms and are described in S-methyl-5-thio-¦Á-D-ribose 1-phosphate degradation II and S-methyl-5-thio-¦Á-D-ribose 1-phosphate degradation III.

While most of the pathway is conserved among the different organisms that possess it, several variants exist that differ in the initial steps of the pathway, between S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA) and S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose 1-phosphate (MTRP). These variants, describing bacteria and plants, higher eukaryotes, and protozoa, are described by several pathways under S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine Degradation. The metabolic differences in the early steps of the methionine salvage pathway are being exploited for developing new drugs targeted against pathogenic microorganisms that utilize the MTA nucleosidase-MTR kinase pathway [Riscoe88, Gianotti90, Tower91].

About This Pathway

This pathway describes the conserved part of the methionine salvage cycle, starting with S-methyl-5-thio-¦Á-D-ribose 1-phosphate. In 6 steps, comprising an isomerase, a dehydratase, an enolase, a phosphatase, an oxygenase, and a transaminase, S-methyl-5-thio-¦Á-D-ribose 1-phosphate is converted to L-methionine [Albers09]. The last enzyme, a glutamine-dependent transaminase, produces the byproduct 2-oxoglutaramate, which is believed to be toxic. Thus an additional enzyme, an ¦Ø-amidase that converts the latter to 2-oxoglutarate, is also considered a part of the pathway [Ellens14].

A few notes of interest about the enzymes of this pathway

At least in some strains, such as Bacillus subtilis, EC 5.3.2.5, 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase, is a member of the RubisCO protein family [Imker07].

The reaction catalyzed by EC 1.13.11.54, acireductone dioxygenase [iron(II)-requiring], can occur non-enzymatically in the presence of air [Wray95]. It is yet unknown whether the non-enzymatic reaction occurs in vivo [Wray95].

If the enzyme that usually catalyzes EC 1.13.11.54, acireductone dioxygenase [iron(II)-requiring] binds a Ni2+ instead of Fe2+, it catalyzes a different reaction ( EC 1.13.11.53, acireductone dioxygenase (Ni2+-requiring)), forming a shunt of the methionine salvage pathway (see 3-methylthiopropanoate biosynthesis) [Dai01, Dai99a, Wray95]. The purpose of this off-pathway reaction is yet unknown; it may, however, provide a mechanism for regulating L-methionine levels in vivo [Dai01].

Nitric oxide (NO) is the active moiety of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. In the vasculature NO relaxes smooth muscle and inhibits platelet and leukocyte adhesion. Outside the vasculature, NO participates in the immunologic response to infection. It serves as a neurotransmitter and plays an important role in cell signaling in the nervous system, and in synaptic plasticity.

Nitric oxide synthases are a family of enzymes responsible for the NADPH dependent synthesis of nitric oxide from L-arginine and oxygen in the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle.

About this Pathway

Nitric oxide can be synthesized by three nitric oxide synthases from L-arginine generating L-citrulline as a by-product. In this cycle, arginine forms NO and citrulline, and is subsequently regenerated from citrulline by the action of the enzymes argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase. These two enzymes are shared with the urea cycle. Citrulline is also required in protein citrullination.

The citrulline-NO cycle functions in many different types of cells. It has been demonstrated in epithelial cells, chondrocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages and neurons [Hecker90][Wu92].

The enzymes argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase confer cells with the capacity to produce NO without the need for exogenous arginine. In vascular smooth muscle cells argininosuccinate lyase is constitutively expressed but argininosuccinate synthase is inducible by cytokines and bacterial endotoxin [Hattori94].",NA,

Most organisms have to deal with the excretion of nitrogen waste originating from protein and amino acid catabolism. In aquatic organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia (ammonotelism). Land-dwelling organisms that cannot directly remove toxic ammonia have developed ways to to convert the ammonia to either urea (ureotelism) or uric acid (uricotelism) which are much less toxic.

The urea is formed in a cyclic pathway, in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney of mammals. It was initially named the Krebs-Henseleit cycle after its discoverers, and later became known simply as the urea cycle or ornithine cycle [Krebs32]. It was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered, five years before the discovery of the TCA cycle. It was clarified in the 1940s as the roles of L-citrulline and L-arginino-succinate as intermediates became understood [Jackson86].

About this Pathway:
The amino groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea at the cost of 3 ATP molecules and the hydrolysis of 4 high energy phosphate bonds.

Two molecules of NADH are produced by reactions associated with the urea cycle. The NADH can enter the electron transfer chain to generate four molecules of ATP. The deamination of L-glutamate by the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenases produces one molecule of NADH and ammonia that can enter the urea cycle [Shashidharan94].

Fumarate is converted to (S)-malate by cytosolic fumarate hydratase, which in turn is converted to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase 1 generating the second molecule of NADH [Grisham83].

The first step of the pathway is catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthase I which is allosterically activated by N-acetyl-L-glutamate. N-acetyl-L-glutamate is produced from L-glutamate by N-acetylglutamate synthase [Jackson86]. This enzyme is regulated by both its own substrate L-glutamate and by L-arginine, a component of the urea cycle.

The cycle consists of five reactions. The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria resulting in the synthesis of L-citrulline. L-citrulline leaves the mitochondria to enter the cytosol where the remaining three reactions occur. Citrulline also plays a role in protein citrullination.

Absence of any urea cycle enzyme is lethal. Congenital deficiencies of any of the enzymes of the urea cycle or liver failure cause hyperammonemia, characterized by mental retardation and lethargy.",NA,

Phospholipids are mostly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once synthesized, they are transported to other phospholipid containing membranes.

At least three different pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of a phosphatidylethanolamine in plants: The decarboxylation pathway ( phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis I), the O-phosphoethanolamine transfer pathway ( phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis II), and the base (head group) exchange pathway ( phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis III).

Tetrapyrroles play a role in a variety of biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. They are large macrocyclic compounds derived from a common biosynthetic pathway [Schulze06]. Tetrapyrrole compounds possess four rings of the pyrrole type, generally linked together by single-atom bridges between the ¦Á positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings. They usually function as a metal-binding prosthetic groups. Many important biological functions are performed by metal ions held as complexes within tetrapyrroles. In mammals, the function of hemoglobin and cytochromes is dependent on the tetrapyrrole heme which contains a Fe2+ complex [Battersby80].

About this Pathway:
In mammals, the common tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway begins with the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine to yield 5-aminolevulinate. This is then converted in the subsequent steps of the pathway to uroporphyrinogen-III, the first macrocyclic tetrapyrrole, and the pathway branch point. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of other tetrapyrroles, which in mammals involves heme, see heme biosynthesis. In other organisms tetrapyrroles such as chlorophyll, cobalamin, coenzyme F430 and phytochromobilin are synthesized [Tanaka07].",NA,

The sulfonation of biological compounds (sulfoconjugation) is a fundamental metabolic process, in which a sulfate group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond. The sulfonation of biomolecules occurs widely and results in a dramatic change in the physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds [Huxtable86].

Sulfonated macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans and heparin are involved in many important processes, such as cell adhesion, hemostasis and the viscoelastic properties of connective tissue [Girard98].

The sulfonation of tyrosine residues by protein-tyrosine sulfotransferase 1 and protein-tyrosine sulfotransferase 2 are a post-translational modification for many secretory and membrane proteins. Sulfated versions of lipids such as sphingolipids and galactoglycerolipids are found in the brain, peripheral nerves, and reproductive tissues of mammals.

In addition, sulfoconjugation is important in the biotransformation of many low molecular weight compounds such as neurotransmitters and hormones, including catecholamines, iodothyronines, and steroids. Another role for sulfonation is the detoxification and removal of drugs and xenobiotics compounds [Venkatachalam98].

About This Pathway:
In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule [Gregory60]. In many organisms, including plants and mammals, 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate (PAPS) is the universal sulfonate donor for all sulfotransferase reactions [Robbins58, Farooqui80].

The activation of inorganic sulfate to form PAPS is achieved by the action of the bifunctional enzyme 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase [Lyle94]. The enzyme has both sulfate adenylyltransferase and adenylyl-sulfate kinase activities. There are two isoforms of the enzyme in humans, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 1 and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 2 [Xu02].

The first step involves the reaction of inorganic sulfate with ATP to form adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The second step involves the reaction of APS with ATP to form 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate and ADP. In mammals, all of the APS is converted to PAPS and used for sulfonation [Venkatachalam98].",NA,

Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via glycerone phosphate), fatty acid metabolism (via acetone), and protein metabolism (via aminoacetone). Methylglyoxal is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see [Kalapos99] for a review). There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds. These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.

About This Pathway:
In this pathway, methylglyoxal is reduced to acetol by the action of various enymes possessing L-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reductase activity. Most of the enzymes that have been characterized with this activity belong to the family of NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductases (AKRs). For example, the human aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) and aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) are both capable of reducing methylglyoxal to acetol [Vander92].

Prolonged incubations of E. coli cell-free extracts with methylglyoxal resulted in conversion of acetol to (S)-propane-1,2-diol [Ko05]. The enzyme proposed to catalyze this reaction is L-1,2-propanediol dehydrogenase / glycerol dehydrogenase [Tang82, Kelley85]. In bacteria (S)-propane-1,2-diol is a dead-end metabolite and exits the cell rapidly [Zhu89]. The same reaction has also been observed in mammalian systems, where it is catalyzed by aldose reductase [Vander92]. In mammals (S)-propane-1,2-diol is metabolized in the liver to L-lactate [Vander92].",NA,

Its life cycle consists of two stages, a flagellated trophozoite that replicates in the host, and a dormant cyst stage in which the organism is transmitted. Encystment is induced in response to bile in the gastrointestinal tract.

The outer cyst wall is rich in a homopolymer of (¦Â1->3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues that is biosynthesized from a UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine precursor. This pathway describes the biosynthesis of this precursor, which is derived from endogenous glucose that is converted to fructose-6-phosphate by glycolytic enzymes.

UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine is converted to the homopolymer by cyst wall synthase [Karr04]. The last five enzymes of the pathway are transcriptionally activated when trophozoites are induced to encyst. Their activities greatly increase during encystment.

About 50 different nucleoside diphosphate sugars have been isolated, and many of these have been shown to be intermediates in the biosynthesis of various types of complex carbohydrates [Ning00]. These substances and the enzymes involved in their synthesis, i.e., the nucleoside diphosphate sugar pyrophosphorylases, have been found in many organisms, including microorganisms, plants and animals [Danishefsky67].
The biological synthesis of GDP-¦Á-D-glucose was first described in 1961 in bovine mammary gland [Carlson62]. The authors found that it was synthesized from GTP and ¦Á-D-glucopyranose 1-phosphate by the enzyme glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, which they partially purified. A similar enzyme was partially purified from human mast cell tumors [Danishefsky67]. That enzyme also had GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase activity. Surprisingly, no further work has focused on this enzyme since the 1967 publication.
A dimeric GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.13) has been purified from pig liver, and was shown to have higher activity with GDP-¦Á-D-glucose (assayed in the reverse direction) than with GDP-¦Á-D-mannose [Szumilo93]. The purified small subunit from that enzyme was able to catalyze the GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase activity on its own, but had no activity with ¦Á-D-glucopyranose 1-phosphate, prompting the authors to suggest that the (uncharacterized) large subunit may be responsible for the GDP-D-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity.

Tetrahydrobiopterin is an important cofactor for many biological processes and is present in all mammalian cells [Thony00]. It is required for aromatic amino acid hydroxylations and nitric oxide synthesis [Cai02].

Tetrahydrobiopterin is also involved in neurotransmitter release in the brain and regulation of human melanogenesis [Mataga91][Schallreuter94]. Deficiency causes severe neurological disorders characterized by hyperphenylalaninaemia, monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency and also Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and depression [Blau, Thony00].

About This Pathway:
Tetrahydrobiopterin is formed de novo in a three step pathway from GTP [Thony00]. The pathway involves two unstable intermediates, 7,8-dihydroneopterin 3'-triphosphate and (6R)-6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin, which have been isolated.

The pathway is catalyzed by the three enzymes, GTP cyclohydrolase I, 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. The rate limiting step of cofactor biosynthesis is catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I [Ichinose95]. The initial reaction is sensitive to end-product feedback inhibition by tetrahydrobiopterin, but only when GTP cyclohydrolase I is complexed with GTP cyclohydrolase 1 feedback regulatory protein [Milstien96]. The activity of the pathway is stimulated by phenylalanine through GTP cyclohydrolase 1 feedback regulatory protein. The outcome of the pathway is (6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin in mammals.",NA,

In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as UDP-¦Á-D-glucose, CMP-3-deoxy-¦Â-D-manno-octulosonate and dTDP-¦Á-D-fucopyranose, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids [Zhou98, Giermann02, Schroder05, Zrenner06].

In addition to de novo biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the de novo biosynthesis pathways (see pyrimidine ribonucleosides salvage I, pyrimidine nucleobases salvage I and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides salvage). The de novo biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the de novo biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the de novo pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level. These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

The pyrimidine nucleotide de novo biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors oxaloacetate and D-ribose 5-phosphate. L-aspartate, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the TCA cycle.

About This Pathway:
The de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts hydrogencarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-¦Á-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to UMP (uridine 5'-monophosphate), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides (see UTP and CTP de novo biosynthesis).

The first enzyme, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, glutamine-hydrolyzing, forms carbamoyl phosphate which is not only an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis but also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as L-arginine, L-citrulline and L-canavanine.

The next step, catalyzed by aspartate carbamoyltransferase, is the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate with L-aspartate forming N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate [Nasr94], which is cyclized to (S)-dihydroorotate, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring. (S)-dihydroorotate is oxidized to orotate by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.

The final two steps, the condensation of orotate with PRPP forming orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP) followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. The last step is considered the rate-limiting step of the overall de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides [Trentmann95].

In plants, the two initial enzymatic reactions of this pathway occur in the plastids, while all of the remaining reactions occur in the cytosol and mitochondria [Witz12]. This implies that N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate must be exported from the plastids. A plastidic nucleobase transporter specific for uracil (a precursor for pyrimidine salvage pathways) has been reported [Witz12]. Since the reaction catalyzed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase occurs in the mitochondria, transporters for both (S)-dihydroorotate and orotate must exist, although they have not been identified yet.

The de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. Although the enzymatic steps in this pathway are conserved throughout all organisms, some differences in the enzymes do exist. For example, in plants and bacteria the three steps leading from carbamoyl phosphate to orotate are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by the single multifunctional CAD protein [Iwahana96]. The last two steps of the pathway are carried out by a bi-functional enzyme ( UMP synthase) in plants and animals [Doremus86, Trentmann95, Gao99] whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for that purpose.",NA,

Legumes solved this problem by establishing a symbiotic relationship with bacteria from the genus Bradyrhizobium, which contain the enzyme nitrogenase. Nitrogenase catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric N2 to ammonia, which can be used to meet the plant's metabolic nitrogen requirements (see nitrogen fixation I (ferredoxin)).

The ammonia generated by the bacteria is first converted into the amino acid L-glutamine and then incorporated into IMP (IMP), a purine synthesized de novo during nitrogen fixation by roots (see superpathway of purine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis I).

Before the fixed nitrogen can be used by the plant, it must be converted into organic forms that can be transported throughout the plant and further metabolized. There are two major forms of organic nitrogen compounds that can be transported - amides (such as L-asparagine and L-glutamine) and ureides (such as allantoin and allantoate). Temperate-region legumes, such as pea, are amide exporters, while legumes of tropical origin, such as soybean, kidney bean and peanut, export nitrogen in the form of ureides (see ureide biosynthesis).

The pathway that is described here, the conversion of IMP to urate, is part of the pathway leading to the production of ureides in plants. However, it is also a part of the degradation of purines, which is found in many organisms. Many mammals, for example, can mineralize purines completely to TCA cycle building blocks in a pathway that includes this subpathway. Humans and apes possess this pathway, but do not have the enzyne urate oxidase ( EC 1.7.3.3, and thus accumulate urate, which has to be disposed of via urine.",NA,

Ubiquinone, also known as coenzyme Q, is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in eukaryotes and prokaryotes [Trumpower81]. Ubiquinone is a lipid consisting of a hydrophobic isoprenoid tail and a quinone head group. The tail varies in length depending on the organism, and it anchors ubiquinone to the membrane, while the quinone head group mediates activity for the respiratory chain.

Ubiquinone undergoes reversible redox cycling between the quinone (Q), semiquinone and hydroquinone (QH2) forms. In eukaryotes, ubiquinone sits on the inner mitochondrial membrane and shuttles electrons from Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) to Complex III (the cytochrome bc 1 complex) [Jonassen00].

Extramitochondrial ubiquinone acts as a lipid-soluble antioxidant that can scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals directly or indirectly by reducing ¦Á-tocopherol ( vitamin E) radicals [Kagan90].

The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that accumulate pathway intermediates; some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.

About This Pathway:
Ubiquinone 10 is the main quinone in humans. In the first step of this pathway, multiple units of 3-methylbut-3-en-1-yl diphosphate (IPP) undergo a series of polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain. The sequential addition of isoprenyl units to (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate is performed by decaprenyl diphosphate synthase [Saiki05].

The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the mevalonate pathway, which feeds isoprene units into trans, trans-farnesyl diphosphate biosynthesis. Following addition of the polyprenyl tail by 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase, the product 4-hydroxy-3-decaprenylbenzoate is processed in three steps, namely decarboxylation, oxidation and methylation.

The prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways differ in the order of these steps: in eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated prior to decarboxylation; in prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation and methylation [Shepherd96].

There are at least two accessory proteins, Atypical kinase COQ8A, mitochondrial and AarF domain-containing protein kinase 4, both mitochondrial protein kinases, that are essential for the proper functioning of this pathway [Mollet08][Ashraf13].",NA,

The heme degradation pathway that is found in animals is based on the activity of EC 1.14.14.18, heme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) [Tenhunen68]. This enzyme catayzes the opening of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle of heme b, forming (Z,Z)-biliverdin-IX ¦Á, Fe2+, and carbon monoxide. The enzyme uses heme as both a substrate and a cofactor, and has been purified from many animals, including humans [Tenhunen69, Yoshida78, Yoshida79, Rotenberg91, Schuller99]. After the enzyme binds ferric-heme, one electron is donated by EC 1.6.2.4, NADPH¡ªhemoprotein reductase, converting the heme-iron to the ferrous state. Molecular oxygen then binds the reduced pentacoordinate heme to form a meta-stable oxy complex. A one electron reduction and protonation yields a ferric-hydroperoxo complex that self-hydroxylates at the ¦Á-meso carbon. The ferric ¦Á-hydroxyheme is then converted to biliverdin through multiple oxidoreductive steps and a verdoheme intermediate [Schuller99, Unno07]. It should be noted that a very similar enzyme also occurs on some bacteria, although the electron donor for the bacterial enzyme is different [Wilks98, Zhu00].
In animals (Z,Z)-biliverdin-IX ¦Á is reduced to (Z,Z)-bilirubin-IX ¦Á by EC 1.3.1.24, biliverdin reductase. This cytosolic enzyme was originally discovered in Guinea pig liver [Singleton65], and has been characterized from several mammals, including rat and humans [Maines93, Maines96]. Two forms of biliverdin-IX ¦Á reductase and two forms of biliverdin-IX ¦Â reductase have been purified from human liver [Yamaguchi94].
Bilirubin is an effective chain-breaking antioxidant in vitro [Stocker87], although it has been questioned whether if fulfills this role in vivo [Fauchere94]. Proposed roles for bilirubin in vivo include a scavenger of nitric oxide [Mancuso03] and an endogenous modulator of neurotrophin redox signaling [Mancuso08].
Unconjugated bilirubin is extremely water insoluble. It is carried (mostly by albumin) to the liver, where it is converted to glucuronides, which are water soluble. The glucuronides are eventually excreted in bile. Glucuronated forms include two positional isomers of a monoglucuronoside ( C8-¦Â-glucuronosyl-bilirubin-IX ¦Á and C12-¦Â-glucuronosyl-bilirubin-IX ¦Á) as well as bis(¦Â-glucosyluronate)bilirubin-IX ¦Á [Jansen71, Gordon76, Blanckaert80]. Two glucuronosyltransferases, encoded by the UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 genes, have been associated with this process. Both catalyze the formation of both monoglucuronoside isomers as well as the bisglucuronoside.
It should be noted that while most of the bilirubin in adult humans is the ¦Á form, it is the ¦Â form that predominates in fetal bile. Other enzymes are responsible for the degradation of the ¦Â form [Yamaguchi94, Komuro96].",NA,

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) must be activated by post translational modification before it can participate in the initiation of protein synthesis. The modification involves the addition of a n-butylamine residue (derived from spermidine) to a highly conserved lysine in the eIF-5A protein. This results in the formation of an unusual amino acid called hypusine. The biosynthesis of hypusine occurs exclusively within the eIF-5A precursor, and is catalyzed by two enzymatic steps, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH).

The strict substrate specificity for hypusine modification provides possible drug targeting of these enzymes, particularly in aberrant cell proliferation [Wolff07].",NA,

The transition element molybdenum (Mo) has been long known as an essential micronutrient across the kingdoms of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. However, molybdate itself is catalytically inactive and, with the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, needs to be activated through complexation by a special cofactor. This molybdenum cofactor (moco) consists of a unique tricyclic pterin compound (molybdopterin) containing a Mo-binding and -coordinating dithiolene group. Moco finally binds to diverse apoproteins and confers activity to the resulting holoproteins ubiquitously involved in essential redox reactions in the global C-, N-, and S-cycles [Hille96] [Hansch05].

Although molybdenum enzymes are found in all organism kingdoms only four enzymes have been reported in plants so far [Mendel02]. However, the importance of those enzymes is highlighted by the fact that unavailability of Mo, hence failure to complement the apoproteins with moco is lethal for the organism. Moco enzymes in plants are subdivided into two classes, assimilatory nitrate reductase (NADH) [Crawford88] and sulfite oxidase [Eilers01] originating from the dioxo-form of moco and xanthine dehydrogenase [Hesberg04] and aldehyde oxidase / indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase / abscisic aldehyde oxidase [Seo00] that require the addition of a terminal inorganic sulfur to the Mo center (sulfo-form of moco) for enzymatic activity.

The chemical nature and biosynthesis of moco has been investigated in detail in bacteria, e.g. [Wuebbens95, Pitterle93, Pitterle93a, Rajagopalan92, SantamariaArauj04]. The group of R.R. Mendel (TU Braunschweig) has considerably contributed to the corresponding research in plants which results have been summarized in several excellent reviews [Schwarz06, Mendel06, Mendel02, Mendel05, Mendel97].

About This Pathway:
Plant enzymes such as aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) depend on the sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (moco). The so called maturation of moco involves the addition of sulfur to the Mo center. In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by EC 2.8.1.9, molybdenum cofactor sulfurtransferase (e.g. the plant ABA3) [Bittner01, Heidenreich05]. This enzyme is a two-domain protein. The N-terminal ABA3-NifS domain generates an enzyme-bound persulfide intermediate whereas the C-terminal domain is probably involved in recognizing target enzymes and posttranslational activation of ABA3 [Bittner01].

Prokaryotes do not have such an enzyme. In prokaryotes MoCo first binds to a chaperone before it is sulfurylated by EC 2.8.1.7, cysteine desulfurase. See for example bis(guanylyl molybdopterin) cofactor sulfurylation and cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor sulfurylation.",NA,

It is an important constituent of milk fats, lard, and cocoa and shea butters. Stearate was first described by Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1823, and its name comes from Greek for ""hard fat"", reflecting the fact that stearate forms a waxy solid [Sampath05].

In animals the precursor of stearate, palmitate, is produced by the fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex, which is found in the cytoplasm (see palmitate biosynthesis (cytoplasm)). Further elongation, starting with stearate, is performed mainly in the ER by several membrane-bound enzymes. The enzymatic steps involved in the elongation process are principally the same as those carried out by FAS. However, the four principal successive steps of the elongation are performed by individual proteins, which may be physically associated [Nugteren65, Jakobsson06].

Prior to elongation, palmitate is activated to palmitoyl-CoA by long-chain-fatty-acid--CoA ligase 1 or a similar isozyme. The activated form is the substrate for the key enzyme of the pathway, the condensing enzyme, or elongase, which determines the rate of fatty acid elongation. Six distinct fatty acid elongase (Elovl) subtypes are present in the mouse, rat, and human genomes. However, only two of them, ELOVL1 and ELOVL6, are taking part in the elongation of palmitoyl-CoA to stearate in the ER.

Several attempts that have been made to purify the enzymes involved in the microsomal elongation process were largely unsuccessful, owing to the hydrophobic properties of the proteins [Jakobsson06]. One exception was the partial purification of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase from rat liver microsomes [Bernert79].",NA,

Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers [Prieschl00], and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function [Resh99].

There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms, named type I and type II. The type I system is found in mammals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see fatty acid synthase from Homo sapiens), while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex (see fatty acid synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants [White05], parasites of the Apicomplexa phylum [Ferguson07] and mitochondria [Zhang03a, Miinalainen03]. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of a soluble [acyl-carrier protein].

Both systems operate in animals - the type I system, based on the fatty acid synthase enzyme, operates in the cytosol (this pathway), while a type II system operates in the mitochondria (see myristate biosynthesis (mitochondria)).

About This Pathway:
Mammalian fatty acid synthase enzymes are homodimers whose gigantic subunits (about 240 kDa) are encoded by a single gene [Guy78]. Each subunit is multifunctional protein, whose main function is to catalyze the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the presence of NADPH. The two subunits are arranged in a head to tail fashion, and each subunit contains, in addition to an acyl-carrier-protein (acp) domain, additional domains that catalyze 7 different catalytic activities.

The complex catalyzes seven successive cycles, and the final product is palmitoyl-CoA. Although small amounts of stearate are sometimes formed through the actions of FAS, the process generally stops at 16 carbons, and palmitate is released from the ACP moiety [Sampath05].

A general description of the reactions catalyzed by the mammalian fatty acid synthase complex is provided by EC reaction 2.3.1.85:

acetyl-CoA + n malonyl-CoA + 2n NADPH + 2n H+ ¡ú a long-chain fatty acid + n CO2 + (n+1) coenzyme A + 2n NADP+

Serotonin and melatonin are both derived from the amino acid L-tryptophan. Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter found in the CNS and gut. In the CNS, it is causally involved in the regulation of mood, sleep, appetite, memory and learning [Popova06]. Modulation of serotonin at synapses is the modus operandi of several classes of antidepressants. Serotonin in the periphery is expressed in the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract and regulates gut motility. Released from the enterochromaffin cells, it is taken up by platelets and plays a role in primary homeostasis and cell mediated immune responses [Berger09]. Circulating serotonin derived from peripheral tissues is primarily metabolized in the liver to 5-hydroxyindole acetate, which is excreted in the urine, see serotonin degradation.

Melatonin is a hormone regulating a number of different physiological functions including sleep induction, circadian rhythm, oxidative stress and immune response [Vanecek98]. It is synthesized nocturnally in the pineal gland [Reiter10].

About this Pathway:
The biosynthesis of serotonin and melatonin utilize some common reactions starting from L-tryptophan. Tryptophan hydroxylase catalyzes the rate-limiting step of serotonin biosynthesis, the oxidation of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan [Wang02b]. The reaction, which occurs in the presence of molecular oxygen, requires a tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor. Aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase is a pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to the indoleamine serotonin [SumiIchinose92].

Serotonin N-acetyltransferase catalyzes the N-acetylation of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin, the rate-limiting step in melatonin synthesis. It is this enzyme which controls the circadian rhythm of melatonin production by the pineal gland. In all vertebrates, enzyme activity is highest at night time and activity decreases very rapidly upon exposure to light [Klein97]. Rhythms in the mammalian pineal gland are set by afferent information derived from the endogenous clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase is the last enzyme of the melatonin biosynthesis pathway, catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine onto N-acetyl-serotonin, to produce melatonin.

Melatonin levels are under strong genetic influence and have heterogeneous expression among individuals [Stehle11]. Abnormal melatonin synthesis has been reported as a risk factor for a variety of medical conditions, such as diabetes and psychiatric disorders [Barnard08].",NA,

In the second part of the pathway, a set of three enzymes removes two methyl groups from the A ring of 14-demethyllanosterol, resulting in formation of zymosterol.

The demthylation sequence starts with sterol C4-methyl monooxygenase. This enzyme acts in three steps - it first adds a hydroxyl group to the methyl carbon, converting it to a hydroxylmethyl group. It continues by oxidation of the hydroxyl moiety resulting in a formyl group, and ends with the addition of a second hydroxyl group, generating a carboxyl group. This carboxyl is then removed by the second enzyme, C-3 sterol dehydrogenase. In the process of decarboxylation, a hydroxyl group attached to another carbon of the sterol ring is oxidized to a keto group, and in order to complete this cycle, the third enzyme, 3-keto sterol reductase, restores it back to the initial hydroxyl group.

L-carnitine is a zwitterionic, quaternary amine carboxylate that has essential roles in intermediary metabolism including energy metabolism, hormonal action and stress adaptation. It plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial L-carnitine shuttle, the transport of activated fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix for ¦Â-oxidation. L-carnitine is also involved in the transfer of the products of peroxisomal ¦Â-oxidation to the mitochondria for oxidation in the TCA cycle. Other functions include modulation of acyl-CoA/CoA ratios, energy storage as acetylcarnitine, and excretion of poorly metabolized acyl groups as carnitine esters [Vaz02].

L-carnitine is used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations, and methods have been described for its production and separation from its D-carnitine enantiomer [Freimuller02, Castellar98].

About This Pathway:
Apart from dietary intake of L-carnitine, most eukaryotes are able to synthesize this compound from N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine. The trimethyllysine is generated by the hydrolysis of proteins containing lysines that are trimethylated at their ¦Å-amino group by a protein-dependent methyltransferase in a S-adenosyl-L-methioninedependent reaction which occurs in lysosomes or the proteasome [Strijbis10]. Proteins modified in this way include calmodulin, myosin, actin, cytochrome C and histones. The rate of carnitine biosynthesis depends upon the availability of N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine in the mitochondrial matrix, the site of trimethyllysine dioxygenase activity.

The C3 hydroxylation of N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine by trimethyllysine dioxygenase yields 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine. This compound must enter the cytosol from the mitochondria for the next step of the pathway, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aldolytic cleavage of 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine to 4-trimethylammoniobutanal and glycine performed by a cytosolic aldolase [Strijbis10]. The gene encoding this aldolase has proved elusive to date, and it has been suggested that cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 or a threonine aldolase may perform this function in mammals [Strijbis10]. A transport system for N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine and 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine has been postulated [vanVlies07].

After dehydrogenation to ¦Ã-butyrobetaine by 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase in the cytosol, this compound enters the circulation and is actively transported primarily into the kidney and liver. In these organs cytosolic ¦Ã-butyrobetaine dioxygenase hydroxylates this compound at C3 to produce L-carnitine. L-carnitine enters the circulation and is taken up by other tissues via active, sodium-dependent transporters [Steiber].",NA,

Polyamines such as spermine and spermidine are required for normal cellular function through their interaction with cellular macromolecules. They are critical regulators of cell growth, differentiation and death. Their metabolism is complex and many mechanisms regulate their levels to maintain polyamine homeostasis, including transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation. Polyamine research has been of particular interest in the development of drugs to treat parasitic infections and cancer.

The three polyamines spermine, spermidine and putrescine are biosynthesized from L-arginine (via L-ornithine) and L-methionine (see pathways spermine biosynthesis, spermidine biosynthesis and putrescine biosynthesis III). Their degradation has been described as a retroconversion (or counter-conversion) of the biosynthetic process. Reviewed in [Wallace03] and [Wanders06]. Also see putrescine degradation III.

About This Pathway:
The main mechanism for spermine and spermidine degradation involves the use of acetyl-CoA to convert them to N1-acetylated derivatives in the cytosol (a rate-limiting, or regulatory step) controlled by the inducible enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. This is followed by oxidation of the N1-acetylated derivatives in perosxisomes by a peroxisomal polyamine oxidase that has a preference for acetylated substrates. In addition, a cytosolic spermine oxidase degrades spermine to spermidine.

In addition to their retroconversion to spermidine or putrescine, the N1-acetylated derivatives are also exported from normal cells into the extracellular environment, as is putrescine. However, they are found in high concentration inside cancer cells, which links altered polyamine metabolism with carcinogenesis. This is an active field of research. The direct conversion of spermine to spermidine without acetylation, via spermine oxidase, is a more recent discovery and its significance to polyamine metabolism is under investigation.

The rates of oxidation and reduction of NAD+ and NADH must be continuously balanced within the cell to maintain the pathways of anabolism and catabolism. NADH produced in the cytosol during glycolysis needs to be oxidized to NAD+ and the NADH oxidation process in the cell occurs primarily via mitochondrial respiration.
NADH cannot traverse the inner mitochondrial membrane and cytosolic reducing equivalents (hydrogen atoms) must be transferred to the mitochondria across the membrane via metabolite shuttles that operate between the two compartments [Tobin80].
The shuttle involves a reaction between NADH and an oxidized substrate in the cytosol, the reduced substrate is transported into the mitochondrion and subsequently reoxidized by the electron transfer chain. There are two well established shuttles for the transport of reducing equivalents described for vertebrates, the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle and the malate-aspartate shuttle.

About this Pathway:
This shuttle involves the combined actions of cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase I and mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase II. The cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the NADH dependent conversion of glycerone phosphate to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, which can pass through the permeable mitochondrial outer membrane.
The sn-glycerol 3-phosphate is oxidized to glycerone phosphate at the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane by mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase I which donates the electrons to the mitochondrial quinone pool. The glycerone phosphate is channeled back to the cytosol. The shuttle also operates in yeast, animals and plants [Shen06a][Ansell97, Larsson98].
Mutations in the GPD1 gene are associated with transient infantile hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver and hepatic fibrosis, presumably caused by defects in the shuttling of reducing equivalents via the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle [BaselVanagaite12].",NA,

Morphine is a plant ( Papaver somniferum, opium poppy)-derived alkaloid and one of the strongest known analgesic compounds. The presence of opiate receptors in mammalian tissue suggests that endogenous ligands must exist. Other types of evidence, such as an increased urinary morphine concentrations observed in a parkinsonian patient undergoing L-dopa therapy prompted suggestions for a possible biosynthetic pathway of morphine from L-dopa in humans [Matsubara92].

The occurrence and/or formation of the simpler alkaloid (S)-norlaudanosoline has been reported multiple times from human and rodent brain tissue as well as in urine [Sandler73, Turner74, Cashaw87, Cashaw93, Sango00, Collins04].

Following the discovery of opioid peptides, evidence was obtained for the presence of small amounts of morphine alkaloids in animals. The origin of the endogenous morphine has been a matter of controversy. Studies involving heavy-isotope labelling experiments have suggested that human cells are capable of synthesizing endogenous morphine [Poeaknapo04, Boettcher05].

The first part of the proposed pathway, up to (S)-reticuline, which is described here, is different from the plant pathway (as described in (S)-reticuline biosynthesis I). The second part of the pathway, as described in morphine biosynthesis, is proposed to be identical between human cells and the opium poppy.

The proposed pathway starts with two molecules of L-tyrosine, which have to be converted to the intermediates 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and dopamine, respectively.

Several routes can lead to the formation of these intermediates: L-tyrosine can be hydroxylated to yield L-dopa, which can undergo either decarboxylation to dopamine or a possible deamination to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)pyruvate, which, in turn, is assumed to be decarboxylated to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. In a parallel route L-tyrosine can be decarboxylated to tyramine, which could then be converted to dopamine by the action of an enzyme such as the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, which has been reported to catalyze this reaction in human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells [Zhu05]. However, a subsequent study reported that isolated human white blood cells (PMN and MN) do not transform tyramine by action of CYP2D6 to dopamine and fail to synthesize morphine [Boettcher06].

Once both intermediates are formed, they could be enzymatically condensed to (S)-norlaudanosoline, which has been observed in brains and urine of different mammals as described above. In order to produce morphine, (S)-norlaudanosoline needs to be methylated three times to form (S)-reticuline, which is subsequently converted to (R)-reticuline, a key intermediate in morphine biosynthesis. Since the exact sequence of methylation reactions is still not known, they are shown as a single general uncharacterized reaction in this pathway.

Injection of (S)-norlaudanosoline intraperitoneally into mice followed by analysis of urine metabolites revealed the presence of salutaridine, an intermediate in the opium poppy morphine biosynthetic pathway derived from (R)-reticuline. Similarly, injection of salutaridinol (which is derived from salutaridine in the pathway) was followed by detection of thebaine in the urine. Finally, injection of thebaine resulted in traces of morphine in the urine [Grobe10].

It should be noted that this pathway was proposed based on heavy-isotope labelling and radiotracer experiments, and very few enzymes have been characterized so far. The human cytochrome P-450 enzymes 2D6 and 3A4 and the rat cytochrome P450 2D2 have been shown to catalyze the activity of EC 1.14.19.67, salutaridine synthase [Grobe09, Grobe12], and the human N-methyltransferase encoded by the INMT gene has been shown to act on the (R) enantiomers of some benzylisoquinolines including (R)-norlaudanosoline [Grobe11]. This last observation suggests that the pathway may proceed via (R) enantiomers, and not (S) enantiomers as shown here.",NA,

The thyroid hormones L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) are essential for normal metabolism, growth and development. These iodide-containing molecules are biosynthesized in the thyroid gland, the function of which is to concentrate environmentally scarce iodide in order to make it available for thyroid hormone biosynthesis. iodide insufficiency in the diet remains a public health problem in some parts of the world (reviewed in [Bizhanova09]). Various human disorders of thyroid metabolism are characterized by hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, goiter, and cretinism (a syndrome resulting from hypothyroidism during development (in [Voet04]). These phenotypes have many possible causes including mutations in receptors, transporters, proteins involved in the pathway and its regulation, developmental defects, inflamation, autoimmune reactions, drug side effects, diet, or deficiency of other hormones. Also see pathways thyroid hormone metabolism I (via deiodination) and thyroid hormone metabolism II (via conjugation and/or degradation).

The specialized biosynthesis of thyroid hormones in the follicles of the thyroid gland has been described and illustrated in the [Bizhanova09] review. The follicles are lined with a single layer of thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes). The lumen of the follicles is filled with a colloid composed mainly of the protein thyroglobulin. Thyroid hormones are derived from tyrosyl resides in this large glycoprotein, by a unique mechanism. iodide is taken up by thyrocytes at the basolateral membrane via the sodium-iodide symporter NIS (TC# 2.A.21.5.1), with energy for the sodium gradient generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase (EC 3.6.3.9) (TC# 3.A.3.1.1). iodide efflux through the apical membrane of the thyrocyte into the follicular lumen is mediated in part by the pendrin anion transporter (Na+-independent) (TC# 2.A.53.2.4). Upon reaching the cell-colloid interface in the follicular lumen, iodide is oxidized and incorporated into tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin (organification) as described below (reviewed in [Bizhanova09]). Studies suggest that specific tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin are involved (reviewed in [Dunn99]).

About This Pathway:
The organification reaction that incorporates iodide into tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The generation of hydrogen peroxide is mediated by the calcium-dependent NADPH dual oxidase type 2 (DUOX2) (EC 1.6.3.1). Thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed iodide incorporation forms a [thyroglobulin]-3-iodotyrosine and a [thyroglobulin]-3,5-diiodotyrosine. This enzyme also catalyzes the coupling of a [thyroglobulin]-3-iodotyrosine and a [thyroglobulin]-3,5-diiodotyrosine to form a [thyroglobulin]-triiodothyronine (T3), or the coupling of two a [thyroglobulin]-3,5-diiodotyrosine residues to form L-thyroxine (T4) (note - click on this reaction in to see the correct stoichiometry) (in [Bizhanova09]). The coupling reaction results in the production of a a [thyroglobulin]-aminoacrylate (thyroglobulin-dehydroalanine) derivative of thyroglobulin after release of the thyroid hormone outer ring from the thyroglobulin polypeptide. This aminoacrylate residue then becomes hydrated to a L-serine residue [Gavaret81]. Thyroid peroxidase has been identified and characterized as a major autoantigen in autoimmune thyroid disease [Dubska06].

Release of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine or L-thyroxine occurs by initial proteolysis in the lumen to solubilize the colloidal, cross-linked thyroglobulin. Further lumenal proteolysis can liberate L-thyroxine [Friedrichs03]. After pinocytosis of the partially degraded thyroglobulin into the thyrocyte, it is further proteolytically digested by lysosomal proteases, liberating 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine. Proteases involved in these processes include the cathepsins. Studies of cathepsin-deficient mice suggested that cathepsin B, cathepsin K and cathepsin L have a role in proteolytic release of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine and L-thyroxine from thyroglobulin in vivo. A sequence of proteolytic events leading to thyroglobulin degradation was proposed [Friedrichs03]. In vitro studies of purified human thyroid cathepsin D precursor degradation of rabbit thyroglobulin identified its cleavage specificities. This enzyme was previously shown to be important in this process [Dunn91].

Hormone secretion into the bloodstream occurs through the basolateral membrane of the thyrocyte. This secretion step remains uncharacterized. Released mono- and diiodotyrosine molecules remain in the thyrocyte and are deiodinated by iodotyrosine dehalogenase. The released iodide can be exported into the lumen and reused (in [Bizhanova09] and reviewed in [Dunn01]). In blood, thyroid hormones are transported in complex with thyroxine-binding globulin, prealbumin and albumin, and are taken up by target cells (in [Voet04]).

This biosynthetic pathway is regulated by complex positive and negative regulatory mechanisms involving the hypothalmus-pituitary-thyroid axis and production of hypothalmic thyrotropin releasing hormone, pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone and nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (reviewed in [Chiamolera09]). After biosynthesis, the biological activity of the 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine or L-thyroxine products of this pathway is mainly regulated in tissues by the selenoenzyme iodothyronine deiodinases, and thyroid hormone transporters (in [Peeters06]). See pathways thyroid hormone metabolism I (via deiodination) and thyroid hormone metabolism II (via conjugation and/or degradation).

Another type of deiodinase, iodotyrosine deiodinase, catalyzes a reductive deiodination of 3-iodo-L-tyrosine and 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine residues that are also released from thyroglobulin by proteolyis. Its function is to salvage iodide from these molecules. The crystal structure of a soluble domain of this membrane-bound flavoprotein has been solved [Thomas09].",NA,

About This Pathway:
The thyroid hormones L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine are regulated at many levels. An important aspect of their regulation is enzymatic activation and inactivation. Three different types of deiodinases are primarily responsible for these processes. They are selenoenzymes that contain selenocysteine as a key active site residue. Type I deiodinase can catalyze both 5'-deiodination and 5-deiodination of a variety of iodothyronines and their derivatives. Type II deiodinase efficiently catalyzes 5'-deiodination of L-thyroxine to 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine, an activating reaction. This reaction contributes to systemic and serum 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine levels. Although L-thyroxine is the major secreted product of the thyroid gland, 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine is the major bioactive hormone and most circulating 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine is generated by type II deiodinase in peripheral tissues (in [Moreno94]). Type III deiodinase produces inactive or less active metabolites by catalyzing the 5-deiodination of L-thyroxine to 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine (reverse triiodothyronine), and the 5-deiodination of triiodothyronine to 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Although the roles of these enzymes in some physiological situations have been determined, their roles in others remain unclear. Reviewed in [St09].

3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine may not only be converted to 3,3'-diiodothyronine as shown, but also to the in vivo metabolite 3,5-diiodothyronine by an uncharacterized enzymatic process (not shown). Subsequent conversion to monoiodothyronines and L-thyronine by uncharacterized processes can also occur (not shown) (reviewed in [Moreno08]).

Human polymorphisms in the genes encoding the deiodinases have been described, although no inactivating mutations have been reported. Phenotypes of mice with targeted deletions of the deiodinase genes have been studied (reviewed in [Peeters06]).

The thyroid hormones L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) are essential for normal vertebrate metabolism, growth and development. These iodide-containing molecules are biosynthesized in the thyroid gland, the function of which is to concentrate environmentally scarce iodide in order to make it available for thyroid hormone biosynthesis. iodide insufficiency in the diet remains a public health problem in some parts of the world (reviewed in [Bizhanova09]). Various human disorders of thyroid metabolism are characterized by hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, goiter, and cretinism (a syndrome resulting from hypothyroidism during development (in [Voet04]). These phenotypes have many possible causes including mutations in receptors, transporters, proteins involved in the pathway and its regulation, developmental defects, inflamation, autoimmune reactions, drug side effects, diet, or deficiency of other hormones. Also see pathways thyroid hormone biosynthesis and thyroid hormone metabolism I (via deiodination).

About This Pathway:
The thyroid hormones L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine are regulated at many levels. In addition to deoidination (see pathway thyroid hormone metabolism I (via deiodination)), other routes of thyroid hormone metabolism have been described and metabolically active metabolites have been identified. These routes are shown here for L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine, although other iodothyronines can be similarly metabolized. In some cases however, the enzymes involved in formation of these metabolites have not been characterized (reviewed in [Moreno08]).

Glucuronidation, or sulfoconjugation of iodothyronines has been shown to occur. Glucuronidation of L-thyroxine or 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine is catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and is a major pathway. It may involve the phenolic hydroxyl group to form ether glucuronides, or the carboxyl group to form ester glucuronides [Tong07]. Glucuronidation aids hormone excretion in bile. Sulfoconjugation by various tissue sulfotransferases, such as sulfotransferase 1A1, can promote hormone degradation by deiodinases in the liver. Alternatively, hormone recycling can occur via reverse reactions catalyzed by tissue sulfatases, intestinal bacterial sulfatases, or intestinal bacterial ¦Â-glucuronidases ( [Moreno94] and reviewed in [Moreno08] and [Wu05a]).

Small amounts of L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine may also be transaminated, or oxidatively deaminated, at the alanine side chain to yield tetraiodothyroacetate (tetrac) or 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetate (triac). Oxidative deamination possibly by kidney L-amino acid oxidase appears more likely, although this remains to be demonstrated (in [Wu05a] and in [Moreno94]). tetraiodothyroacetate and 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetate may be conjugated to form glucuronides. Depending upon species, ether glucuronides or ester glucuronides of these metabolites may form by conjugation of the phenolic hydroxyl group, or carboxyl group respectively [Moreno94].

L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine may also be deiodinated to 3-monoiodothyronine and the thyronine nucleus by uncharacterized enzymatic processes, followed by decarboxylation at the alanine side chain to 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) and thyronamine (T0AM), respectively (reviewed in [Moreno08]). The decarboxylation reaction is possibly catalyzed by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (in [Moreno08, Wu05a, Scanlan04]). However, the specific enzymes involved in these conversions remain to be shown.

Cleavage of the ether link of the thyronine nucleus has also been suggested to be a mode of degradation (not shown). This reaction produces diiodotyrosine from the inner ring, and the outer ring phenolic iodine is removed. Peroxidases can catalyze this reaction (reviewed in [Wu05a]).",NA,

Se0 is an essential trace element for humans. The best studied biological form of Se0 is the amino acid L-selenocysteine (sec).

In L-selenocysteine the thiol group of L-cysteine is replaced by a selenol group. L-selenocysteine is considered to be the 21st genetically encoded amino acid because it is co-translationally inserted into nacent polypeptide chains at an in-frame UGA nonsnense codon in the mRNA. This is done by a decoding mechanism that involves a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the mRNA and coordinated interactions between RNA-protein complexes. A model for the role of these cytoplasmic and nuclear supramolecular complex interactions in L-selenocysteine biosynthesis has been proposed [SmallHoward06]. The function of L-selenocysteine in proteins remains to be completely defined, although its occurrence in the active site of some redox-active enzymes suggests a role in their catalytic mechanism. This pathway for selenocysteine biosynthesis is found in archaea and eukaryotes.

About This Pathway:
The pathway shown here is found in humans [Xu07]. It is an indirect, tRNA-dependent pathway for amino acid biosynthesis in which the amino acid is synthesized on its tRNA. A non-cognate amino acid is first attached to the tRNA and is then converted to the cognate amino acid by tRNA-dependent modifying enzymes. Other examples of an indirect, tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthetic pathway are L-asparagine biosynthesis III (tRNA-dependent) and glutaminyl-tRNAgln biosynthesis via transamidation (as compared with tRNA charging).

In this pathway, an L-seryl-[tRNAsec] is first converted to an O-phospho-L-seryl-[tRNASec] by a kinase and the O-phosphoserine-containing product is transformed to L-selenocysteine by SepSecS. selenophosphate is the Se0 donor, synthesized from hydrogen selenide and ATP by selenophosphate synthetase (in [Xu07a]). Reviewed in [Sheppard08, Xu07b].

In this pathway of L-selenocysteine biosynthesis on a tRNAsec, a tRNAsec is charged with L-serine. The seryl moiety of the an L-seryl-[tRNAsec] formed is phosphorylated by O-phosphoseryl-tRNAsec kinase to form an an O-phospho-L-seryl-[tRNASec] intermediate which is then modified to an L-selenocysteinyl-[tRNAsec] by O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase. Thus, the backbone for L-selenocysteine is L-serine. Although the pathway is identical in archaea and eukaryota, a difference between them in a tRNAsec identity elements for the phosphorylation reaction has been found. Reviewed in [Sheppard08, Xu07b].

an L-seryl-[tRNAsec] is first converted to an O-phospho-L-seryl-[tRNASec] by O-phosphoseryl-tRNAsec kinase and the bound O-phospho-L-serine is converted to L-selenocysteine by O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase using selenophosphate. Reviewed in [Sheppard08, Xu07b].",NA,

The neurotransmitter and neuromodulator serotonin has important roles in the mammalian central nervous system including learning, memory and development. Imbalance of serotonin levels is associated with a variety of neurological disorders. Although the central nervous system has been the focus of serotonin research, only a small percentage of total body serotonin is produced and stored in serotonergic neurons of the central nervous system, where it is released into synapses. Approximately 95% of the serotonin in humans originates in the enteric nervous system, where it is produced and stored in enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Upon release it is taken up by platelets and stored in dense granules (in [Squires07] and [Jonnakuty08]). serotonin in peripheral tissues has important roles in the regulation of many physiological processes. Additionally, a serotonergic system in mammalian skin for the biosyntheis and metabolism of serotonin, N-acetyl-serotonin and melatonin has also been studied [Slominski03, Semak04]. Reviewed in [Jonnakuty08, Rosen09] and [Slominski05]. See pathway serotonin and melatonin biosynthesis.

About This Pathway:
monoamine oxidase A is primarily responsible for the oxidative deamination of serotonin to 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde although monoamine oxidase B can function in its absence (in [Squires06]). Circulating serotonin is mostly derived from peripheral tissues and is primarily metabolized in the liver to 5-hydroxyindole acetate, which is excreted in the urine. The minor metabolite 5-hydroxytryptophol is more hydrophobic and is first sulfated, or glucuronidated before urinary excretion ( [Helander95] and in [Some02]). Low levels of serotonin O-sulfate, produced by phenol (aryl) sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.1), have been identified in both the central and enteric nervous systems [Squires07, Tyce86] and isoforms SULT1A1, SULT1A3 and SULT1C#2 have been shown to sulfate serotonin [Yasuda07]. 5-hydroxyindole thiazolidine carboxylate is a condensation product of 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde and L-cysteine that has been shown to form in the central and enteric nervous systems, but does not accumulate presumably due to the action of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, EC 1.2.1.3) [Squires06]. In addition, 7-hydroxylated serotonin may be formed as a result of cellular oxidative stress and subsequently sulfated [Yasuda07] (not shown).",NA,

The catecholamines dopamine, (R)-noradrenaline (norepinephrine), and (R)-adrenaline (epinephrine) function as neurotransmitters and hormones. They have important physiological regulatory roles and are involved in the development of many diseases. Their biosynthesis from L-tyrosine is shown in pathway catecholamine biosynthesis. Overall, approximately half of the dopamine produced in the body is not converted to (R)-noradrenaline and is degraded to inactive metabolites (in [Eisenhofer97]) (see pathway dopamine degradation). Although the degradation of endogenous catecholamines has been well studied, many inaccuracies based on early studies still remain in the literature. For example, (R)-noradrenaline degradation has been depicted as a series of reactions, including oxidative deamination, that form 3,4-dihydroxymandelate, followed by O-methylation to form vanillylmandelate. However, updated pathways are shown in [Eisenhofer04] and here.

Catecholamines are biosynthesized in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, including the central nervous system, sympathetic nerves, adrenal medulla, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. They have previously been considered to be metabolized after their release from cells. They are now believed to be largely metabolized in the cells in which they are biosynthesized. In addition, intracellular catecholamines stored in vesicles were believed to be released extracellularly only upon stimulation. It is now thought that vesicular catecholamines are in a dynamic equilibrium with the cytoplasm. Outward leakage from vesicles is countered by active transport back into vesicles by monoamine transporters. The small amount of catecholamines remaining in the cytoplasm are a major source of metabolites. Reviewed in [Eisenhofer04].

The metabolism of the transient (and toxic) aldehyde intermediates of catecholamine metabolism 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (this pathway) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (see pathway dopamine degradation) is dependent upon the presence (in (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-adrenaline) or absence (in dopamine) of the ¦Â-hydroxyl group. Its absence in dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde favors oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Its presence in (R)-noradrenaline, (R)-adrenaline and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde favors reduction by aldehyde reductase, or aldose reductase. Thus, dopamine is preferentially converted to an acid metabolite, and (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-adrenaline are preferentially converted to an alcohol metabolite. Reviewed in [Eisenhofer04].

About This Pathway:
The major route of vanillylmandelate production from (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-adrenaline is currently believed to involve initial oxidative deamination to the unstable aldehyde intermediate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde and reduction to (R)-3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol by aldehyde reductase (alcohol dehydrogenase) [Mardh86] (or aldose reductase as stated in [Eisenhofer04]). These reactions occur mainly in neuronal tissue, whereas the O-methylation of (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol occurs in extraneuronal tissues. (R)-3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol is O-methylated to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and this alcohol is dehydrogenated to the unstable aldehyde intermediate 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde which is then dehydrogenated to vanillylmandelate, the major end product of (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-adrenaline degradation. Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase play the major role in vanillylmandelate production in liver. vanillylmandelate is excreted in urine. Reviewed in [Eisenhofer04, Goldstein03].

An alternative route following the oxidative deamination of (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-adrenaline to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is its dehydrogenation to 3,4-dihydroxymandelate, which was believed for many years to be the main route. It is now considered by [Eisenhofer04] to be quantitatively insignificant under normal conditions and (R)-3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol is the main product (see above). Consequently, the O-methylation of 3,4-dihydroxymandelate to vanillylmandelate is no longer considered to be the main source of vanillylmandelate. Reviewed in [Eisenhofer04].

Two minor routes that contribute to vanillylmandelate production are via the O-methylation of (R)-noradrenaline and (R)-adrenaline to L-normetanephrine and metanephrine, respectively. These compounds are oxidatively deaminated to the unstable aldehyde intermediate 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde [Suzuki85]. This compound may also be reduced to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in a minor reverse reaction. Reviewed in [Eisenhofer04].

In addition to the above pathways, the sulfates of L-normetanephrine, metanephrine and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol can be formed by sulfotransferase 1A3/1A4 (EC 2.8.2.1) in cells that contain this activity. Glucuronides of these compounds may also be formed and are either excreted in bile, or they may enter the circulation and be excreted in urine (reviewed in [Goldstein03]) (not shown).",NA,

This pathway depicts the degradation of purine nucleotides to purine nucleosides, purine bases, and urate. Further degradation is shown in the pathway llink. Purine degradation plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in most organisms. The pathway in vertebrates is discussed below. Fungi, bacteria and archaea can utilize some of the intermediates in this pathway and the linked pathway as sole sources of nitrogen, or nitrogen and carbon ( [Pope09, Schultz01, DeMoll93] and reviewed in [Vogels76].

In Escherichia coli exogenous purine nucleosides and purine bases are converted to nucleotides via salvage pathways. Although all of the enzymes of the pathway shown here are present in this organism, aerobic purine degradation is incomplete and does not progress past (S)-(+)-allantoin or allantoate formation, and this catabolism does not suffice as a source of nitrogen under aerobic growth conditions [Xi00]. However, (S)-(+)-allantoin can be degraded anaerobically [Cusa99]. See pathways purine ribonucleosides degradation, purine deoxyribonucleosides degradation I and allantoin degradation IV (anaerobic).

The pathways of biosynthesis and degradation of mammalian purine and pyrimidine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides were elucidated in the 1950s and 1960s. Much work in the 1970s and 1980s focused on inborn errors of purine metabolism, although the regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis and the metabolism of purine bases and nucleosides were also studied. More recent work on purine and pyrimidine metabolism using genomics, proteiomics and metabolomics is likely to impact several areas of clinical research including studies of a possible role for high levels of soluble urate in cardiovascular diseases; the development of purine and pyrimidine analogs for the chemotherapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases as well for antiviral and antiparasitic drugs; and the development of urate-lowering drugs for the treatment of gout. Reviewed in [Becker08] and [Nyhan].

About This Pathway:
In mammals both purine ribonucleotide and purine deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates are degraded similarly using a final common pathway. The degradation reactions of purine ribonucleotide monophosphates are shown here as in [Fox81, Simoni07, Alexiou92] and [Pauly00]. Purine degradation in higher plants is very similar. However, plants contain an enzyme, guanosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.15) that is not present in vertebrates [Roberts03]. The plant pathway is shown in purine nucleotides degradation I (plants).

Related pathways of eukaryotic purine de novo biosynthesis and purine salvage (reutilization) are shown in pathways superpathway of purine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis I, adenosine nucleotides degradation II and xanthine and xanthosine salvage. Rodent studues have demonstrated the catabolism of dietary purines by epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. These cells coexpress key purine catabolic enzymes [Witte91] .

The first step in degradation involves hydrolysis of purine ribonucleotides to ribonucleosides by 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5). As stated in [Fox81] this step can also be catalyzed by non-specific phosphatases such as EC 3.1.3.2 (not shown). AMP is deaminated to IMP (EC 3.5.4.6). Ribonucleosides are converted to purine bases and ¦Á-D-ribose-1-phosphate by phosphorolysis catalyzed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1). adenosine is deaminated to inosine (EC 3.5.4.4), and guanine is deaminated to xanthine (EC 3.5.4.3). hypoxanthine is converted to xanthine, which is then converted to urate by the same enzyme, xanthine oxidoreductase (xanthine dehydrogenase EC 1.17.1.4, xanthine oxidase EC 1.17.3.2). This is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway. Reviewed in [Fox81, Okamoto08] and [George09]).

Also shown in this pathway is the degradation of XMP, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of GMP from IMP (see pathway superpathway of purine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis I). XMP degradation is included in some pathway diagrams [Alexiou92, Voet04]. XMP has been shown to be a substrate for 5'-nucleotidase EC 3.1.3.5 (reviewed in [Hunsucker05]). xanthosine, in addition to guanosine and inosine, is also a substrate for phosphorolysis by purine nucleoside phosphorylase EC 2.4.2.1 [Stoychev02] and reviewed in [Kulikowska04]. Unlike the prokaryotic purine nucleoside phosphorylase, adenosine is not a natural substrate for mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase (in [Stoychev02]).

The end product of purine catabolism depends upon the taxon of the organism in question. urate is the end product in humans, hominoid primates (i.e. chimpanzees, gorillas), new world monkeys, birds and reptiles. Higher primates contain a mutational inactivation of the liver enzyme uricase and cannot produce allantoin. allantoin is produced in non-primate mammals and old world monkeys, which produce uricase (see linked pathway urate conversion to allantoin I). Other organisms can also produce and further catabolize allantoin (see the pathway link in urate conversion to allantoin I and subsequent links). In [Johnson09] and in [Anzai05].

In humans, urate in blood enters the kidney but most is reabsorbed by a renal urate reabsorption system. Only approximately 10% is excreted. Kidney urate transporting systems are still under investigation. Both urate and allantoin are found in the urine of species that produce them (reviewed in [Anzai05]).

Abnormalities of the human pathway occur as a result of enzyme deficiencies, enzyme overactivities, and increased turnover of nucleic acids due to certain disorders. Conditions resulting in increased degradation of ATP, or decreased synthesis of ATP, also affect purine nucleotide degradation. After purine nucleotide dephosphorylation, the salvage (reutilization) reactions may be a major regulatory mechanism (reviewed in [Fox81]) (see pathways adenosine nucleotides degradation II and xanthine and xanthosine salvage). The enzymes of the pathway occur in a variety of mammalian tissues. In mice the highest levels of purine catabolic enzymes have been found in the proximal small intestine [Mohamedali93].

It mediates the biological response of a large number of hormones and neurotransmitters in target cells by regulating calcium release from intracellular stores. D-myo-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate is synthesized by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid that is located in the plasma membrane, by the action of phospholipase C, as described in D-myo-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate biosynthesis.

Once formed, the levels of D-myo-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate are tightly regulated by two mechanisms.

In the first mechanism the compound is dephosphorylated to D-myo-inositol (1,4)-bisphosphate [Downes82, Storey84], initiating a pathway that recycles the inositol moiety to the plasma membrane as phosphatidylinositols.

In the second mechanism, it is phosphorylated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase to D-myo-inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate. This compound has been suggested to have roles in controlling calcium homeostasis, transferring calcium between intracellular stores, and/or regulating calcium entry across the plasma membrane [Irvine91]. It may also play a role in regulating cross-talk between the calcium and other signaling pathways. A D-myo-inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate-binding protein has been identified that can stimulate the GTPase activity of the ras and rap small GTP binding proteins [Cullen95, Soriano97].

The indoleamine melatonin is a vertebrate hormone secreted by the pineal gland.

It is ubiquitously present in cells and body fluids due to its amphiphilic properties that allow it to cross membranes. Mitochondria have the highest intracellular concentration of melatonin [Semak05]. Its functional groups allow both specific receptor binding and a role in oxidation chemistry. melatonin is also found in invertebrates [Hardeland03], protozoa [Kohidai03], plants [Van01a], fungi [Hardeland03] and bacteria [Tilden97] although its function in many cases remains incompletely defined. melatonin is also used as a human dietary supplement.

About This Pathway:
This oxidative pathway of melatonin degradation involves cleavage of the pyrrole ring of melatonin to the 5-methoxylated kynuramine N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK). It has been demonstrated in human neutrophils [Ximenes05] and cultured human keratinocytes in vitro [Fischer06]. It is also the dominant pathway of pineal melatonin degradation in the mammalian brain and central nervous system [Hirata74, Hardeland06].

N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine can be formed from melatonin enzymatically by several enzymes including myeloperoxidase [Ximenes05, Ferry05] and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (in a peroxidase-like reaction with hydrogen peroxide as co-substrate) [Ferry05]. More recently, rat liver microsomal and mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes have also been implicated in the formation of N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine and 2-hydroxymelatonin [Semak08]. The involvement of mitochondrial cytochrome C in the conversion of melatonin to N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine via hydroxylated intermediates has also been suggested [Semak05].

N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine can also be formed nonenzymatically in reactions involving oxyferryl-hemoglobin, hemin, ultraviolet B radiation, reactive oxygen species, or reactive nitrogen species (not shown). Many other melatonin metabolites, such as cyclic-3-hydroxymelatonin and 2-hydroxymelatonin can also be formed in such nonenzymatic reactions [Fischer06, Slominski08] (not shown). In fact, the number of ways in which N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine can be formed is remarkable.

The deformylation of N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine to N-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine can occur enzymatically via formamidase [Hirata74]. Catalase has also been shown to catalyze this reaction in vitro ( [Tan00] and reviewed in [Tan00a, Hardeland09]). The reaction can also occur nonenzymatically as a result of ultraviolet irradiation. melatonin and its metabolites N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine and N-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine have antioxidant activity [Hardeland05]. Reviewed in [Hardeland08, Slominski08, Hardeland09].

N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine has been identified in many different organisms, from protozoa to plants and metazoa. However, in the lower taxa it is likely formed by nonenzymatic reaction(s). The metabolite N-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine can also undergo various nonenzymatic reactions (not shown) (reviewed in [Tan07]).",NA,

Pyrimidines can be catabolized through two different pathways, thymine degradation and uracil degradation I (reductive) using the same enzymes but with different products.

About This Pathway:
The reductive pathway of thymine is essentially the same in bacteria and mammalian tissues [FINK52, FRITZSON57]. The product of the pathway, (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate, is a non-protein amino acid [Solem74]. The stereoisomer of this compound, (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate, is produced in L-valine degradation. While the (S) isomer is reabsorbed into the plasma, the (R) isomer is eliminated in urine [Solem74, vanGennip81].

The pathway proceeds in three sequential enzymatic steps. The first enzyme is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)], which catalyzes the reversible reduction of thymine to 5,6-dihydrothymine [Van04]. The second enzyme, dihydropyrimidinase performs reversible hydrolytic ring-opening of 5,6-dihydrothymine to 3-(carbamoylamino)-2-methylpropanoate [Hamajima98]. Finally, ¦Â-ureidopropionase catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of 3-(carbamoylamino)-2-methylpropanoate to (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate in a reaction that produces ammonia and CO2 [Sakamoto01a].",NA,

Glycosaminoglycans (also known as mucopolysaccharides) are long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit that consists of an N-acetyl-hexosamine and a hexose or hexuronic acid, either or both of which are often sulfated. Members of the glycosaminoglycan family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid unit they contain and the degree of its sulfation (e.g. ¦Â-D-glucuronate, ¦Á-L-idopyranuronate, galactose, N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-¦Â-D-galactosamine, 2-O-sulfo-¦Â-D-glucuronate, N-acetyl-¦Â-D-galactosamine 4-O-sulfate or N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4,6-bissulfate).

Glycosaminoglycans are an important component of connective tissues. Important glycosaminoglycans include chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate containing 4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and L-iduronate 2-O-sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and hyaluronan.

Many of the glycosaminoglycans are covalently linked to proteins, resulting in proteoglycans. Common glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate, heparin, dermatan sulfate containing 4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and L-iduronate 2-O-sulfate and chondroitin sulfate are actually synthesized on the protein chain. This pathway describes the initial reactions that are common to the synthesis of these glycosaminoglycans. All of these glycosaminoglycans are attached via a specific tetrasaccharide known as the ""glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region"". This tetrasaccharide is formed by sequential stepwise additions of the sugar residues to specific core proteins.

The first step in the process is the attachment of a D-xylose group to specific L-serine residues in the core protein. The attachment sites have the consensus sequence L-serine- glycine/ L-alanine-X- glycine. The enzymes catalyzing this reaction are known as xylotransferases ( XYLT1 and XYLT2) and utilize UDP-¦Á-D-xylose as the sourse of the sugar.

The two subsequent additions of galactose units (from UDP-¦Á-D-galactose) are catalyzed by B4GALT7 and B3GALT6, respectively, and the final ¦Â-D-glucuronate residue is transferred from UDP-¦Á-D-glucuronate by one of the three isoforms of galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-¦Â-glucuronosyltransferase ( B3GAT1, B3GAT2 and B3GAT3).

The fifth residue that is added (not described in this pathway) determines the nature of the glycosaminoglycan that would be synthesized from the linkage region. Addition of N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine results in synthesis of heparan sulfate or heparin, while addition of N-acetyl-¦Â-D-galactosamine results in synthesis of chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate containing 4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and L-iduronate 2-O-sulfate.

The synthesis of glycosaminoglycans takes place in the Golgi apparatus, and all of the proteins that participate in this pathway are type II membrane proteins, embedded in the Golgi membrane [Sugahara02].",NA,

Background:

Heparan sulfate is a linear polysaccharide found in all animal tissues. It occurs as a proteoglycan in which two or three heparan sulfate chains are attached to cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins, known as ""core proteins"". Heparan sulfate binds to diverse protein ligands (known as heparin-binding proteins) and regulates a wide variety of biological activities, including developmental processes, cell adhesion and motility, angiogenesis, blood coagulation and tumour metastasis.

The molecule is built of glycosaminoglycan chains attached to specific serine residues in a core protein. The chains are composed of a simple sugar backbone that is modified to different degrees depending on the cellular conditions. The backbone is built of several types of disaccharide building units with different sulfation patterns and can accomodate over 1,000,000 different sequences built up of up to 200 disaccharide units [Sasisekharan00].

The disaccharide building units are composed of a hexose sugar and a uronic acid. The most common repeating unit, which makes up around 50% of the total disaccharide units in heparan sulfate, is composed of ¦Â-D-glucuronate linked to N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine. In other units ¦Â-D-glucuronate may be substituted by ¦Á-L-idopyranuronate or its sulfated form ¦Á-L-iduronate 2-O-sulfate, and N-acetyl-¦Â-D-glucosamine may be sulfated to N-sulfo-D-glucosamine, 2-N,6-O-disulfo-¦Á-D-glucosamine, a [heparan sulfate] containing ¦Á-D-N-sulfoglucosamine 3-O-sulfate or a [heparan sulfate] containing ¦Á-D-N-sulfoglucosamine 3,6-O-bissulfate.

Heparan sulfate chains comprise three different types of domains: S-domains that contain contiguous N-sulfated residues, unmodified N-acetyl-rich regions, and mixed transition zones between the S-domains and the unmodified segments. Only the S-domains have binding capacities for growth factors and other proteins [Gallagher01]. The structure of heparin is very similar, but its chains are not organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains [Murphy04].

The synthesis of heparan sulfate takes place in the Golgi apparatus, with the exception of the first reaction, the attachemnt of xylose to the core protein, which takes place within the endoplasmic reticulum.

About This Pathway

The synthesis of heparan sulfate begins with the formation of a tetrasaccharide linkage region on the core protein, as described in glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region biosynthesis. Once the linkage region is synthesized, a key reaction, catalyzed by EXTL2 and EXTL3, adds an N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine residue to the linkage region tetrasaccharide. This addition is a molecular switch that prevents the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate containing 4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and L-iduronate 2-O-sulfate on the linkage region. The chain is then elongated by the exostosin complex, a bifunctional protein composed of EXT1 and EXT2 units, that can add both ¦Â-D-glucuronate and N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine in an alternating manner to the nascent chain. Once the basic backbone is synthesized, many enzymes alter the structure.

A key enzyme is the bifunctional heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (4 isoforms are encoded by NDST1, NDST2, NDST3 and NDST4). The enzyme removes the acetyl groups from a [heparan sulfate]-N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine residues in what would become S-regions, and sulfates the free NH2 groups, resulting in a heparan sulfate containing ¦Á-D-N-sulfoglucosamine.

It is usually found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan.

Chondroitin sulfate is a major component of connective tissue matrix (such as skin and cartilage), but is also found on cell surface and basement membranes and in intracellular granules of certain cells. Functions in matrix locations are mainly structural, while functions in membranes are mainly as receptors.

Degradation of chondroitin sulfate within the animal is part of many processes. For example, such degradation increases the permeability of connective tissues and decreases the viscosity of body fluids. Although some of the enzymes involved are circulated in the plasma, the general process of chondroitin sulfate degradation generally takes place in the lysosome. Chondroitin degradation promoted by bacterial of other enzymes is also involved in bacterial pathogenesis and the spread of toxins and venoms.

The process starts with hydrolysis of the large chondroitin sulfate polymer to small segments, which is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as hyaluronidases. One of these enzymes, encoded by the HYAL4, is a dedicated chondroitinase. Others, encoded by HYAL1 and SPAM1, have higher affinity towards hyaluronan, but also degrade chondroitin sulfate at a lower rate. Depending on the enzyme, the large chondroitin sulfate polymers are degraded into smaller oligosaccharides, often hexa- and tetrasaccharides, and eventually into disaccharides.

Since the sugars in the chondroitin sulfate molecule are sulfated, dedicated enzymes, such as the arylsulfatase B and N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase remove the sulfate groups, resulting in regular disaccharide molecules that can be degraded further into basic building blocks.",NA,

L-fucopyranose is an important monosaccharide and a carbohydrate component of the human antigenic glycoproteins and glycolipids of erythrocyte membranes. It is found in xyloglucans and rhamnogalacturonans I and II. Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form GDP-¦Â-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as the donor substrate.
The formation of GDP-¦Â-L-fucose occurs via two routes: a) a de novo synthesis route from GDP-¦Á-D-mannose (this pathway), and b) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-Fuc from free L-fucopyranose ( GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis II (from L-fucose)).

Key Notes on the Enzymes:
The de novo synthesis of GDP-Fuc from GDP-D-mannose (GDP-Man) comprises three catalytic steps: a 4,6-dehydration, a 3,5-epimerization, and a 4-reduction. The first reaction step is catalyzed by GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, which involved the formation of the intermediate GDP-4-dehydro-¦Á-D-rhamnose.",NA,

The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward. Degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms, convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization. Salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms. Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types, where a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towards complete mineralization.

About This Pathway:
This pathway of guanosine nucleotides degradation begins with the conversion of GMP to guanosine, which is then converted to the free base guanine by the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Guanine is converted to urate via xanthine by the enzymes guanine deaminase and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase [Ito90a][Stewart84]. This pathway is very similar to guanosine nucleotides degradation II pathway that occurs in plants and fungi. However, in this pathway guanosine is converted to guanine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase and in plants this conversion is catalyzed by guanosine deaminase [Roberts03].",NA,

Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine and play a role in histidine catabolism [Lucock00].

Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons) of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin folium (leaf) [Mitchell88a].

Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series of ¦Ã-glutamyl links to form an oligo-¦Ã-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased [Cossins97, Scott00, Kirk94]. In addition, in eukaryotic cells the glutamylated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments [Appling91].

Tetrahydrofolate (tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate, H4PteGlu1, THF) is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions, see folate transformations I, and the number of conjugated glutamate residues, see folate polyglutamylation.

About This Pathway:
While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the de novo synthesis pathway (see superpathway of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis), many of them are also capable of salvaging folate from different varieties, such as the 5,10-methenyl form, or the 5- or 10-formyl forms. This pathway describes the conversion of pre-existing 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate.

As vertebrates are not able to synthesize folate in vivo, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate (formyl-H4PteGlun) [Thien77]. The polyglutamyl folates are hydrolyzed to monoglutamate forms by ¦Ã-glutamyl hydrolase, and metabolized 5-methyl-H4PteGlu1. More about that process is found at the pathway glutamate removal from folates.

Insufficient supply of the vitamin in vertebrates leads to anemia in adults, and has been shown to cause neural tube malformation in human embryos [Feinleib01]. In addition, folate defficiency has been linked to a number of other birth defects, several types of cancer, dementia, affective disorders, Down's syndrom, and serious conditions affecting pregnancy outcome (for a review, see [Lucock00]).",NA,

Nicotine in tobacco leaves and in plant-derived preparations is mostly in the (S)-nicotine isomeric form [Armstrong98]. However, tobacco smoke contains up to 10% (R)-nicotine, probably due to racemization during combustion (in [Hukkanen05]). Nicotine is the addictive compound in tobacco [Benowitz94] and is a commonly used psychoactive drug. It enters the body by systemic absorption through cigarette smoking, oral snuff, pipe tobacco, cigars and chewing tobacco use [Benowitz84, Jacob99]. It can also enter in purified form as a medication.

Nicotine has complex physiological effects [Benowitz88]. In cigarette smoke nicotine is carried into the body on particulate matter. It is rapidly absorbed in the small airways and alveoli of the lung [Pankow01]. In this neutral pH environment, it is un-ionized, soluble, and can be transferred accross cell membranes and into the blood. It moves into the pulmonary venous circulation, to the left ventricle of the heart, and into the systemic arterial circulation [Lunell96, Rose99]. It travels to the brain within seconds where it binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors and activates the dopaminergic reward system [Perry99] (and reviewed in [Benowitz96]). Other forms of nicotine (such as nicotine gum, transdermal patch, inhaler, lozenges, and sublingual tablets) are usually buffered at alkaline pH and quickly traverse cell membranes, but most reach the blood and brain more slowly. They are less likely to cause addiction due to the delayed reward of nicotine effects [Benowitz88a, Henningfield93], and reviewed in [Hukkanen05].

In humans, the primary site of nicotine metabolism is the liver. There is little evidence in the literature for any extrahepatic metabolism, despite the presence of isoforms of nicotine metabolizing enzymes in other tissues (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). Nicotine and its metabolites are excreted in urine, where they have been analyzed and quantitated [Benowitz94, Byrd, Meger02, Kyerematen90]. These data showed considerable interindividual variability in the amount of each metabolite produced [Benowitz94a, Benowitz94, Byrd].

Cotinine is the primary metabolite of nicotine and is found in the urine of smokers [BOWMAN62, Meger02, Byrd, Benowitz94, Kyerematen90]. In studies of nicotine metabolism in smokers, it has been estimated that 70% of a nicotine dose is metabolized to cotinine [Benowitz94]. It reaches high levels in the blood and has a long half-life [Zevin97]. The cotinine metabolite trans-3'-hydroxycotinine is the most abundant metabolite in urine [Benowitz94]. Glucuronide conjugation is a significant route of nicotine metabolism, with nicotine, cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine glucuronides accounting for up to 30% of total metabolites recovered in urine [Byrd] .

nicotine -> cotinine

The nicotine-to-cotinine conversion involves oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). Cotinine is the main metabolite of nicotine in most mammals. The nicotine-to-cotinine conversion was studied in 20 smokers. The authors characterized the disposition kinetics of nicotine and cotinine using deuterium-labeled analogs of these compounds. On average, 72% of nicotine was converted to cotinine and a range of 55-92% indicated individual variations. Nicotine is rapidly metabolized and cotinine is slowly metabolized, but clearances were significantly correlated. The authors suggested that the same enzyme is involved in metabolism of both [Benowitz94a].

The presence of the intermediate, nicotine-¦¤1'(5')-iminium ion, as a discrete entity in this reaction has been demonstrated [Murphy73]. In a rabbit liver microsomal preparation containing nicotine, an NADPH generating system, and potassium cyanide, the formation of 5'-cyanonicotine was shown. It was postulated that 5'-cyanonicotine was produced by reaction of nicotine-¦¤1'(5')-iminium ion with cyanide. The involvement of a mixed-function oxidase was suggested by NADPH as the preferred cofactor, the requirement for O2, and inhibition of the reaction by carbon monoxide. A detailed study of the mechanism of iminium ion formation from (S)-nicotine was done using both human liver and rabbit liver microsomal preparations [Peterson87]. The authors suggested that spacies differences in degree of stereoselectivity could reflect species differences in isozyme composition. The synthesis and structure of crystalline iminium salt has been described and it was shown that nicotine-¦¤1'(5')-iminium ion is in equilibrium with 5'-hydroxynicotine [Brandange79, Peterson87]. The iminium ion is also an alkylating agent, and may have a role in the pharmacology of nicotine [Hibberd81].

More recently, formation of the iminium ion has been described as hydroxylation of nicotine at the 5' position, with nicotine-¦¤1'(5')-iminium ion in equilibrium with 5'-hydroxynicotine, an unstable intermediate [Hecht00]. The reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2A6, but isoforms 2B6 and 2D6 may contribute. Thus 5'-hydroxynicotine may be the aldehyde oxidase substrate to form cotinine.

nicotine -> nicotine 1'-N-oxide

Oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring can also form nicotine 1'-N-oxide, a primary metabolite (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). Nicotine 1'-N-oxide is found in the urine of smokers [Kyerematen90, Meger02, Byrd, Benowitz94]. In animals, both the cis and trans stereoisomers are formed. In humans, the enzyme dimethylaniline monooxygenase (flavin-containing monooxygenase 3) (FMO 3) (formerly FMO II) selectively forms the trans isomer. In human liver microsomal preparations, the formation of nicotine 1'-N-oxide is NADPH dependent [Cashman]. Nicotine 1'-N-oxide is not further metabolized, although evidence has been presented for reduction of this compound back to nicotine in the gut [Beckett70].

nicotine -> nicotine isomethonium ion

The formation of nicotine isomethonium ion involves nonoxidative methylation of pyridine nitrogen (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). This pathway was first reported in dogs given (S)-nicotine [MCKENNIS63]. Animal models and human liver homogenates showed that S-adenosyl-L-methionine is the source of the methyl group. In human liver the (R)-isomer of nicotine is methylated more rapidly than the (S)-isomer, but both enantiomers were methylated [Crooks88]. Small amounts of nicotine isomethonium ion have been detected in the urine of smokers [Neurath87]. Reported pharmacologic activity of this quaternary N-methylated nicotine metabolite warrants further study [Dwoskin92].

nicotine -> nicotine glucuronide

The formation of nicotine glucuronide involves nonoxidative glucuronidation. This results in an N-quaternary glucuronide (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). Nicotine glucuronide is found in the urine of smokers [Meger02, Byrd, Benowitz94]. In smokers' urine, nicotine, cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine glucuronide conjugates constituted 25-30% of total metabolites, and individual variability in degree of glucuronide conjugation was noted [Byrd, Benowitz94].

nicotine -> nornicotine

Nicotine can undergo oxidative N-demethylation to nornicotine (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). Nornicotine is found in the urine of smokers [Kyerematen90, Benowitz94]. Although nornicotine is a naturally occurring minor alkaloid in tobacco, the majority of nornicotine excreted in urine by smokers is derived from nicotine metabolism [Benowitz94]. In rabbit liver microsomes, an N'-methylene-iminium ion intermediate has been shown by formation of the N-(cyanomethyl)nornicotine adduct. The authors suggested that this intermediate is a product of the microsomal mixed function oxidase system. They proposed a mechanism involving oxidation of nicotine to N-(hydroxymethyl)nornicotine, ionization to nicotine-N-methyleniminium ion, and cyanide reaction to form the cyano adduct [Nguyen79].

The oxidative conversion of nornicotine to norcotinine in humans has been cited as unpublished data by Jacob, Yu and Benowitz in a review [Hukkanen05]. Animal studies have presented qualitative evidence for this reaction [WADA61, PAPADOPOULOS64].

The conversion of norcotinine to 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanamide has been shown in rat liver microsomes [Eldirdiri], and in humans the reaction is suggested by the presence of small amounts of 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanamide in the urine of smokers. This compound exists in equilibrium with 5'-hydroxynorcotinine (Jacob, Yu and Benowitz, unpublished, in a review [Hukkanen05]. The reactions converting 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanamide to 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate, with subsequent conversion to 3-pyridylacetate, remain hypothetical in humans (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]. 3-Pyridylacetate has been detected in human urine after oral cotinine administration [MCKENNIS64].

nicotine -> 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate and 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate

Nicotine can also be metabolized via a 2'-hydroxylation reaction producing 2'-hydroxynicotine as an intermediate in the cytochrome P450 2A6 catalyzed conversion of nicotine to 4-(methylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. 2'-Hydroxynicotine spontaneously yields nicotine-¦¤1'(2')-iminium ion, which is in equilibrium with 4-(methylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone [Hecht00] (and reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). About 10% of nicotine and metabolites is excreted as 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate (keto acid) and 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate (hydroxy acid) in the urine of smokers [Hecht99, Hecht99a]. These compounds also arise from metabolism of cotinine [MCKENNIS64]. The final product, 3-pyridylacetate, was detected in human urine after oral cotinine administration [MCKENNIS64].

It has been shown that during nicotine metabolism in humans, 85% of the keto acid formed is converted to hydroxy acid. In rats, only 1% is converted, demonstrating a significant species difference. The hydroxy acid, 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate, can be in equiliburium with the lactone 5'-(3-pyridyl)-tetrahydrofuran-2-one [Hecht00]. In human smokers and smokers wearing a nicotine patch, urine analysis showed that formation of keto acid and hydroxy acid is quantitatively significant, and established this as a pathway of nicotine metabolism in humans. It was suggested that carbonyl reductase activity converts the keto acid to the hydroxy acid [Hecht99a].

In smokers, or people on nicotine replacement therapy, about 10% of a nicotine dose is excreted in urine as 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate and 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate. It was established that the main source of urinary keto and hydroxy acids in humans is via 2'-hydroxylation of nicotine. The cotinine 5'-hydroxylation pathway is minor compared to the nicotine pathway for these compounds. In in vitro studies, when nicotine was added to human liver microsomes containing cofactors, the nicotine-to-keto acid pathway was shown, with 4-(methylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (aminoketone) conversion to the keto acid 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate through a possible keto aldehyde intermediate [Hecht00]. Hyopthetical intermediates in the conversion of 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate to 3-pyridylacetate have been proposed [MCKENNIS64].",NA,

Trans-3'-hydroxycotinine and its glucuronide conjugate are the main nicotine metabolites in the urine of smokers [Benowitz94]. These metabolites account for 40-60% of a nicotine dose [Byrd, Benowitz94, Hecht99]. The reaction is stereoselective for the trans isomer of 3'-hydroxycotinine [Jacob90, Voncken90], although the cis isomer has been detected in smokers' urine [Voncken90]. The most abundant metabolite in the urine of smokers is trans-3'-hydroxycotinine [Neurath87, Benowitz94].

In a human subject given oral cotinine, it was established that humans excrete hydroxycotinine in urine. Crystalline cotinine, hydroxycotinine and 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-N-methylbutanamide were recovered [BOWMAN62]. Hydroxycotinine was also chemically synthesized by these authors [McKennis63]. More recently, the chemical synthesis of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine from cotinine was reported and metabolic formation was found to be stereoselective for the trans isomer [Jacob90]. The degree of glucuronide conjugation in urine was found to vary between individuals [Byrd, Benowitz94], as was the percent of cotinine converted to 3'-hydroxycotinine [Benowitz94].

Trans-3'-hydroxycotinine glucuronide was identified in the urine of smokers and nonsmokers after one dose of intravenous 14C-nicotine. Smokers eliminated nicotine and cotinine more rapidly than nonsmokers who were given these compounds, probably because of inductive effects of smoking on metabolism of xenobiotics in the liver [Kyerematen90]. The 3'-hydroxycotinine glucuronide conjugate found in urine is an O-glucuronide [Byrd94]. Human liver microsomes were found to catalyze N-glucuronidation of nicotine and cotinine, as well as N- and O-glucuronidation of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine. However, only the O-glucuronide was found in urine. The authors concluded that the same enzyme(s) probably catalyze N-glucuronidation of all three compounds and a different enzyme catalyzes O-glucuronidation [Kuehl03a].

cotinine -> 5'-hydroxycotinine

The 5'-hydroxycotinine pathway is considered a minor pathway in humans. The main source of urinary 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate and 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoate is 2'-hydroxylation of nicotine [Hecht00]. The amount of 5'-hydroxycotinine in smokers' urine is <4% of levels of 3'-hydroxycotinine [Neurath94]. When oral cotinine was given to a human and urinary metabolites were analyzed, 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-N-methylbutanamide was identified and its structure determined [BOWMAN62], although the structure was subsequently corrected in another publication [McKennis62]. Conversion of 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-N-methylbutanamide to 3-pyridylacetate in humans is largely hypothetical (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]). In a human subject given oral cotinine followed by urine analysis, the conversion of cotinine to 3-pyridylacetate was shown [MCKENNIS64]. 3-Pyridylacetate was chemically identified as a metabolite of cotinine, but the intermediate pyridyl acids were not identified. Therefore, these reactions remain hypothetical.

cotinine -> cotinine N-oxide

Cotinine N-oxide has been isolated and quantitated from urine of smokers and found to be a minor metabolite of nicotine [Shulgin87]. Cotinine N-oxide is formed from 2-5% of nicotine and metabolites in smokers' urine [Byrd, Benowitz94, Meger02]. Cotinine N-oxide was identified in the urine of smokers and nonsmokers after one dose of intravenous 14C-nicotine [Kyerematen90]. More recently, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy was used to simultaneously identify and quantitate nicotine and 8 metabolites in smokers' urine. Nicotine-N'-oxide, cotinine-N-oxide and norcotinine represented about 10% of nicotine metabolites in urine [Meger02]. Unlike nicotine N'-oxide, cotinine N-oxide is formed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]).

cotinine -> cotinine methonium ion

This reaction involves biological methylation of the pyridine ring of cotinine. Cotinine methonium ion was isolated and identified from human urine after cotinine administration to a single human subject [MCKENNIS63].

cotinine -> cotinine glucuronide

Cotinine glucuronide has been identified in the urine of smokers [Caldwell, Meger02, Byrd94, Byrd, Benowitz94]. It was synthesized and characterized as (S)-(-)-cotinine N-glucuronide, establishing its identity [Caldwell]. Cotinine glucuronide has been directly determined in the urine of smokers (versus indirect assay using beta-glucuronidase treatment of urine and assay of cotinine release). Interindividual differences were seen in the production of cotinine glucuronide [Byrd94].

cotinine -> norcotinine

Norcotinine (demethylcotinine) has been identified in the urine of smokers [Byrd, Meger02]. In smokers and nonsmokers who were given a single intravenous dose of 14C-nicotine, demethylcotinine (norcotinine) was identified in urine [Kyerematen90]. Norcotinine constitutes about 1% of total nicotine and metabolites in smokers urine [Byrd]. There are two pathways for its formation: oxidative metabolism of nornicotine, and demethylation of cotinine. Both pathways have been demonstrated in animals. The conversion of nicotine to nornicotine and then to norcotinine has been shown in rabbit liver [PAPADOPOULOS64]. Dog studies showed the conversion of nicotine to cotinine to hydroxycotinine and norcotinine [WADA61].

N'-hydroxymethylnorcotinine was first detected in vitro in hamster liver microsomes after incubation with cotinine. The compound has been synthesized and characterized [Li94a]. It was speculated to be an intermediate, although contradictory results have been reported [Murphy99]. Therefore, it is a hypothetical intermediate in humans. Norcotinine can be further metabolized by rat liver microsomes to 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanamide. This compound can be converted to 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanoate (reviewed in [Hukkanen05]. Small amounts of 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanamide have been reported in the urine of smokers (Jacob, Yu and Benowitz unpublished, in review [Hukkanen05]. It has been shown that human cytochrome P450 2A6 is involved in the formation of norcotinine, 5'-hydroxycotinine, and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine from cotinine [Murphy99].

Evidence for conversion of 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanoate to 3-pyridylacetate in humans is largely hypothetical. In a human subject given oral cotinine followed by urine analysis, the conversion of cotinine to 3-pyridylacetate was shown [MCKENNIS64]. 3-Pyridylacetate was chemically identified as a metabolite of cotinine, but the intermediate pyridyl acids were not identified. The metabolism of norcotinine to pyridyl acids (via oxidation of the pyrrolidone ring) was shown in the rat and dog, but the authors suggested that this is not necessarily applicable to humans [MCKENNIS64]. Therefore, these reactions remain hypothetical.",NA,

Acetoacetate, (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate and acetone are collectively known as ketone bodies, and their synthesis is known as ketogenesis. Ketogenesis occurs primarily in the mitochondrial matrix of liver cells and is important for providing metabolic fuel for peripheral tissues, especially cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle under exertion. The brain normally uses only glucose as its energy source, but during starvation or glucose dysregulation, ketone bodies serve as its primary fuel as fatty-acids can not pass the blood-brain barrier.
Ketogenesis is the last step of lipid energy metabolism, a superpathway linking dietary lipids and adipose triglycerides to the TCA cycle and respiratory chain. This pathway has three highly regulated control points, adipocyte lipolysis, mitochondrial fatty acid entry, and HMGCoA synthase [Fukao04].

About this Pathway:
Acetoacetate is formed in three reactions: condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 working in the reverse direction from its function in the final step in ¦Â oxidation [Haapalainen07]; condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA with a third acetyl-CoA by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 [Merlin85]; and degradation of HMG-CoA to acetoacetate by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase 1 [Roberts94]. Acetoacetate, a ¦Â-keto acid, undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to acetone. Acetone is exhaled and does not accumulate in the body under physiological conditions.
The liver releases ketone bodies from the mitochondria via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 into the bloodstream for distribution to peripheral tissues and brain where ketone body utilization occurs, see ketolysis [Meredith08]. In a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis), accumulation of these acids can lower blood pH beyond the normal buffering capacity and reduce the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen [Jerreat10]. Also when acetoacetate is produced faster than it can be metabolized, a buildup of acetone results, giving the breath of diabetics with poorly controlled glucose levels a characteristic sweet smell [Nelson98].
Under normal conditions the acetyl-CoA starting material for ketogenesis is generated by ¦Â-oxidation of fatty acids derived from triacylglycerols (TAG) which are metabolized in adipose tissue under the control of hormone-sensitive lipase [Kraemer02]. This is balanced with gluconeogenesis, by directing oxaloacetate out of mitochondria to the cytosol so that acetyl-CoA flux is shifted away from the TCA cycle and towards ketogenesis [LopesCardozo75].
During starvation when TAG stores are reduced, certain amino acids can enter the ketogenesis pathway at different points; L-isoleucine (at acetyl-CoA), L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine (at acetoacetyl-CoA), L-leucine (at HMG-CoA) and L-lysine and L-tryptophan (at acetoacetate).",NA,

In mammals, the liver produces and excretes ketone bodies when high amounts of fatty acids derived from peripheral tissues during starvation or fasting are oxidized by ¦Â-oxidation pathways and the amount of acetyl-CoA produced exceeds the oxidative capacity of hepatic mitochondria, see ketogenesis. In disease states such as diabetes mellitus, extremely high amounts of fatty acids are oxidized as a consequence of lack of insulin or insulin resistance resulting in enhanced ketogenesis [Guo06].

The ketone bodies comprise acetoacetate, (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate and acetone, the last being a nonmetabolizable decarboxylation product of acetoacetate. A potentially life-threatening metabolic acidosis can occur in diabetes mellitus from excess protons provided by acetoacetate and (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate, in excess of the serum bicarbonate buffering capacity [Guo06].

Under physiological conditions, ketone body utilization by peripheral tissues with high energy demands is essential in mammals for survival during times of starvation and extended fasting.

About this Pathway:
This pathway describes the conversion of the ketone bodies acetoacetate and (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate, to acetyl-CoA which feeds into the TCA cycle. Ketone bodies are more efficient energy storage molecules than glucose and ketolysis results in a lower production of reactive oxygen species and less mitochondrial stress [Sullivan04].

Ketone bodies are mostly synthesized in liver mitochondria and exported from hepatocytes for circulation to metabolizing peripheral tissues [Fukao04]. The heart, exercising skeletal muscle and brain in starvation mode, all use ketone bodies as a major energy storage molecule. Various tissues internalize ketone bodies using a number of different monocarboxylate transporters [Meredith08][Pierre05].

The major regulatory control of ketolysis occurs at three points; adipocyte lipolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase, entry of fatty acids into mitochondria by carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (which is inhibited by malonyl-CoA) and regulation of rate-limiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 [Fukao04].

Studies of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have shown that increased utilizaton of ketone bodies as fuel may reduce oxidative stress and protect against neuronal loss [Tieu03][Zhao06a]. Both caloric restriction and a high-fat, low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet are being investigated as a means to reduce oxidative damage to neurons [Maalouf09].",NA,

Sucrose, also known as table sugar or cane sugar, is a white crystalline odorless powder with a sweet taste, that is both an energy storage molecule and an aesthetic component of food. The name ""sucrose"" was coined by the English chemist William Miller in 1857.

Sucrose is widely produced by plants. It is a disaccharide composed of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose.

About this Pathway

When ingested by humans, sucrose is degraded to glucose and fructose in the small intestine by the sucrase component of bifunctional sucrase-isomaltase propeptide attached to the lumenal membrane of enterocytes [Conklin75].

Glucose, as a metabolite of sucrose degradation, is taken up into the small intestine enterocytes by the sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 expressed on the lumenal membrane [Quick03]. Mutations in the SGLT1 gene have been shown to cause glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) resulting in fatal neonatal diarrhea, unless glucose and galactose are removed from the diet [Wright02][Martin96].

Fructose is absorbed by the solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 5 on the brush border membrane of enterocytes of the small intestine [Davidson92a]. The efflux transporter, solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 2, resides in the basolateral membrane of intestinal cells and transports fructose into the bloodstream, where it is carried throughout the body and metabolized further [Colville93].

Fructose was used for intravenous feeding to trauma victims in hospitals, but very high plasma levels carry risks of lactic acidosis and is detrimental to the liver, so this procedure is now generally avoided.",NA,

Cholesterol is released from lipid droplets or endosomes and transported to the mitochondria by carrier proteins. The rate limiting step for steroid hormone synthesis is the transport of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) [Miller07]. StAR functions at the outer mitochondrial membrane to bind and release cholesterol during a pH mediated molten globule confirmational change [Bose99]. The cytosolic carrier proteins, StARD4, -5 and -6, contain a StAR-related lipid binding domain and exhibit tissue specific expression patterns [Soccio03].

This pathway describes the biosynthesis of cortisol from the ¦Ä 5-3 hydroxy steroid, pregnenolone. The initial step is the catalysis of pregnenolone to progesterone. This conversion is carried out in two separate, sequential reactions, first the dehydrogenation of the 3¦Â-hydroxy steroid, producing pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione, followed by an isomerization to progesterone [Thomas95]. This is carried out by a multi-functional enzyme pregnenolone 3-dehydrogenase/progesterone isomerase encoded by HSD3¦Â1 and HSD3¦Â2 which differ in their expression patterns.
The conversion of progesterone to 17-¦Á-hydroxyprogesterone is catalyzed by CYP17A1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of heme containing membrane associated enzymes [White86]. These monooxygenases utilize NADPH for the reduction of molecular oxygen via a membrane bound microsomal electron transfer system. CYP17A1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and catalyzes multiple reactions critical for biosynthesis of adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones.
CYP21A2 another cytochrome P450 superfamily member, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and catalyzes the conversion of 17¦Á-hydroxyprogesterone to11-deoxycortisol [White86]. CYP21A2 is expressed only in the adrenal cortex.
Another member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily CYP11B2, , localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to aldosterone [Kawamoto92].",NA,

Choline plays a key role in several pathways and its concentration in vivo is carefully regulated. Choline is an essential nutrient for fetal and brain development. It is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in humans and is metabolized to produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via choline O-acetyltransferase, or catabolized to glycine betaine [Salvi13]. Glycine betaine plays an important osmoprotectant role in mammals, protects from several other forms of cellular stress and functions as a methyl group donor [Lever10]. In mammals, choline degradation is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation [Mehedint10][Zeisel12].

About This Pathway:
The conversion of choline to glycine betaine is performed by the action of two dehydrogenases and occurs in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial choline dehydrogenase converts choline to betaine aldehyde [Haubrich81]. Multifunctional mitochondrial ¦Á-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of betaine aldehyde to glycine betaine [Brocker10].

The further catabolism of glycine betaine involves the transfer of one-carbon units at the level of active formaldehyde [Binzak01]. The conversion of glycine betaine to N,N-dimethylglycine is catalyzed by betaine--homocysteine S-methyltransferase and occurs in the cytosol [Garrow96]. The next two steps of the pathway occur in the mitochondria. One methyl group is removed from N,N-dimethylglycine to form the modified amino acid sarcosine by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase [Binzak01]. A second methyl group is then removed from sarcosine to form glycine by sarcosine dehydrogenase [Binzak01]. Both enzymes are associated with 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate as a coenzyme, which receives the methyl group from formaldehyde and spontaneously converts to 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate or ""active formaldehyde"" [Binzak00]. In the absence of tetrahydrofolate, formaldehyde and formate are produced [Steenkamp82]. Formaldehyde is oxidized to formate in formaldehyde oxidation II (glutathione-dependent).

In the last step of the pathway, ""active formaldehyde"" donates a methyl group to glycine to form L-serine via the serine hydroxymethyltransferases [Stover97]. Through the requirement for 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate as a cofactor for several of the reactions, this pathway is closely connected to folate transformations I.",NA,

Homocarnosine is a dipeptide found in abundance in mammalian brain and muscle. In human brain, it is synthesized in both glial cells and subclasses of GABAergic neurons, and its concentration is 100 times higher than that of carnosine.
Organisms have developed mechanisms for defence against oxygen induced damage in their adaptation to living in an aerobic environment. Reactive oxygen species damage DNA, lipids and proteins, and have been implicated in ageing, cancer and many other diseases. Homocarnosine has been shown to protect against oxidative stress in mammalian brain and muscle, two tissues that have the most active oxidative metabolism [Kohen88].
Homocarnosine may also be an inhibitory neuromodulator [Petroff98]. The anti-epileptic drug vigabatrin increases both homocarnosine and GABA concentrations, by inhibiting the activity of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase [deBittencourt94]. Epileptic patients given vigabatrin had better seizure control and higher mean homocarnosine levels [Petroff98].

About this Pathway:
Homocarnosine is synthesized from GABA and L-histidine in an ATP dependent reaction catalyzed by carnosine synthase 1 [Drozak10].

GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. It is a key mediator of synaptic plasticity and neuroendocrine function [Lynex04]. Disturbances in the homeostasis of GABA in the brain are implicated in the development of epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, and Stiff-Man syndrome [Lynex04].

¦Â-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent allosteric regulator with dual simultaneous functions. It is an activator of phosphofructokinase and an inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the key rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively [Pilkis95][Rousseau93].
An increased concentration of intracellular ¦Â-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate increases glycolytic flux, while at low concentrations of the metabolite, there is a net increase in gluconeogenic flux [Lee03b]. The metabolic role of ¦Â-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate has great potential for therapeutic intervention in type II diabetes [Okar01].

About this Pathway

The bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFK/FBPases) catalyze both the synthesis and degradation of ¦Â-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate due to two independent catalytic domains in a single polypeptide chain. The kinase domain is localized within the amino-terminal part of the enzyme, and the bisphosphatase domain is in the carboxy-terminal region [Bensaad06].
TIGAR, a novel p53-inducible protein, only catalyzes the dephosphorylation of ¦Â-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Its primary role appears to be protection against oxidative stress [Bensaad06]. It increases flux through gluconeogenesis which increases the isomerization of ¦Â-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate to D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate. The latter metabolite is diverted into the pentose phosphate pathway resulting in the generation of NADPH required for glutathione-peroxide redox reactions and glutathione-glutaredoxin redox reactions and production of glutathione, an important anti-oxidant.",NA,

Lysine is an essential amino acid and its catabolism is unique among the common amino acids in that it proceeds via two distinct major pathways, the L-lysine degradation (saccharopine pathway) and L-lysine degradation (pipecolate pathway), both of which converge into a common degradative pathway [Hallen13]. The ¦Á-amino group of lysine undergoes conversion to an ¦Á-keto group in the pipecolate pathway, while the ¦Å-amino group of lysine undergoes conversion to an aldehyde group in the saccharopine pathway.
The L-lysine degradation (saccharopine pathway) is the predominant lysine catabolic pathway in the developing brain and extracerebral tissue, while the L-lysine degradation (pipecolate pathway) occurs mostly in adult brain. The saccharopine pathway is predominantly mitochondrial and the pipecolate pathway localizes to the peroxisome and cytosol.

About this Pathway:
The first step in this pathway is the conversion of the ¦Á-amino group of L-lysine to an ¦Á-keto group to form 6-amino-2-oxohexanoate. The mammalian enzyme that catalyzes this reaction has not yet been defined and there is debate as to whether it is an oxidase reaction or a transaminase reaction [Hallen13]. In some bacterial species, there is a specific lysine racemace and oxidase that catalyzes this reaction in two steps, see L-lysine degradation V. In rats, peroxisomal D-amino acid oxidase catalyzes the conversion of D-lysine to pipecolate [SCANNONE64].

Lysine was traditionally regarded to be inert to mammalian aminotransferases [Higashino67]. However, it has been demonstrated that in the presence of high levels of L-glutamate as found in the brain, the transamination of L-lysine can occur, with the ¦Á-amino group being transferred to 2-oxoglutarate or another ¦Á-keto acid [Hallen13]. Mouse kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase 3 has some transaminase activity towards lysine with glyoxylate as an amino group acceptor [Han09].

6-amino-2-oxohexanoate is in equilibrium with its cyclic ketimine form 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate. This essentially renders the reverse formation of lysine by a transamination reaction unfavorable.

Cytosolic ketimine reductase mu-crystallin has ketimine reductase activity and catalyzes the reduction of the imine bond in 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate using either NADH or NADPH as cofactor, to yield L-pipecolate [Hallen11]. The peroxisomal sarcosine oxidase catalyzes the dehydrogenation of L-pipecolate to 1-piperideine 6-carboxylate [Dodt00]. The reverse reaction, 1-piperideine 6-carboxylate to L-pipecolate is catalyzed by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 [Struys14]. 1-piperideine 6-carboxylate is in spontaneous equilibrium with its open aldehyde form (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate. This explains why mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene leading to loss of ¦Á-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, result in accumulation and excretion of L-pipecolate in patients. The downstream reactions from (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate for this pathway and L-lysine degradation (saccharopine pathway) are identical.",NA,

L-threonine is an indispensable amino acid and is degraded by two major degradative pathways in vertebrates. In most vertebrates, the degradation of L-threonine occurs through a two-step pathway, L-threonine degradation II, involving the enzymes L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase, where threonine is converted to glycine via the formation of L-2-amino-3-oxobutanoate [Aoyama81][Dale78][Edgar02].

However, while functional L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase has been cloned in many mammals including, goat, pig and mouse, the human enzyme, inactive L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase, has been shown to be a nonfunctional product of a pseudogene [Kao94][Ray85][Edgar02a].

About This Pathway:
In the first step of this two step pathway, L-threonine is deaminated to 2-oxobutanoate in a reaction catalyzed by L-serine dehydratase/L-threonine deaminase [Yamada08]. In the second step, 2-oxobutanoate is converted to propanoyl-CoA catalyzed by the branched-chain ¦Á-keto acid dehydrogenase complex [Paxton86].

thyronamine and its iodinated derivatives are a novel class of signaling molecules that are distinct from thyronines in their lack of the carboxylate group of the ¦Â-alanine side chain. Their physiological roles and their biosynthetic pathways are incompletely understood. They may be synthesized de novo, or they may be derived from iodothyronines, possibly by decarboxylation catalyzed by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (in [Moreno08, Wu05a, Scanlan04, Piehl08a]). Only 3-iodothyronamine and thyronamine have been identified in vivo [Scanlan04] and reviewed in [Zucchi10] and [Piehl11]. Using a reliable and sensitive monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for monitoring 3-iodothyronamine levels in human serum, patient studies suggested that it is mainly produced in extrathyroidal tissues [Hoefig11].

It has been shown in vitro that the entire series of iodothyronamines, like iodothyronines, are substrates for the three types of vertebrate iodothyronine deiodinases, Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3. This supports a role for these deiodinases in thyronamine biosynthesis [Piehl08a]. Also see pathways thyroid hormone metabolism I (via deiodination) and thyroid hormone metabolism II (via conjugation and/or degradation).

About This Pathway£º
In this pathway only 3-iodothyronamine and thyronamine have been identified in vivo. Their functional roles as well as the potential roles of the other metabolites shown remain to be completely elucidated. Using a novel liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry based method, thyronamine and its iodinated derivatives were identified and quantitated [Piehl08a]. They were also shown in assays to be isozyme-specific substrates for the three types of deiodinase isozymes. The isozymes used in this study were derived from human cell lines (Dio1, Dio2 or Dio3), or mouse liver membrane preparations (Dio1) [Piehl08a].

Dio1 in the human HepG2 cell line lysate and Dio2 in the human MSTO-211H cell line lysate deiodinated 3,3',5'-triiodothyronamine and 3',5'-diiodothyronamine at the phenolic (outer) ring. Dio3 in the human ECC-1 cell line lysate deiodinated thyronamines containing iodine atoms in the tyrosyl (inner) ring.

None of the enzymes in this study catalyzed the conversion of 3,3',5,5'-tetraiodothyronamine to 3,3',5-triiodothyronamine, 3,3',5-triiodothyronamine to 3,5-diiodothyronamine, or 3'-iodothyronamine to thyronamine. It was suggested that species-specific factors may modulate the substrate specificity of deiodinase isozymes in different species [Piehl08a, Piehl08]. In this study, Dio1 preparations from human HepG2 cells and mouse liver membrane preparations showed some differences in substrate specificity. Overall, these data also suggested a deiodinase-catalyzed route for 3-iodothyronamine and thyronamine biosynthesis [Piehl08a].",NA,

Vitamin A is the name given to a family of related compounds from the retinoid group, including all-trans forms such as all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinoate, cis forms such as 11-cis-retinol, 11-cis-retinal, 9-cis-retinoate and 13-cis-retinoate, and retinyl esters such as all-trans-retinyl palmitate. Structurally, all retinoids possess a ¦Â-ionone ring and a polyunsaturated side chain, with either an alcohol, aldehyde, a carboxylic acid group or an ester group. The side chain is composed of two isoprenoid units, with a series of conjugated double bonds which may exist in trans- or cis-configuration.

Vitamin A compounds have many important and diverse functions throughout the body including roles in vision, regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, growth of bone tissue, immune function, and activation of tumor suppressor genes.

Animals can not synthesize vitamin A de novo and require a dietary supplement. Carnivorous vertebrate animals can obtain it directly from dietary meat, in the form of retinyl-esters. Vegetarian animals produce retinal from one of four carotenoids: ¦Â-carotene, ¦Â-cryptoxanthin, ¦Á-carotene, and ¦Ã-carotene, which they must obtain from plants or other photosynthetic organisms [Kim09b].

11-cis-retinal is a polyene chromophore, and when bound to opsin proteins it forms the chemical basis of animal vision (see pathway the visual cycle I (vertebrates)). Some microorganisms utilize a similar system in which various cis forms of retinal bound to proteins called type 1 rhodopsins allow them to convert light into metabolic energy.

All-trans retinoate is the vitamin A form that mediates the functions required for growth and development. During early embryonic development, retinoate generated in a specific region of the embryo helps determine position along the embryonic anterior/posterior axis by serving as an intercellular signaling molecule that guides development of the posterior portion of the embryo [Duester08]. It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages [Holland07]. In the adult, retinoate is responsible for most of the activity of vitamin A (see retinoate biosynthesis I).

Retinoid-Binding Proteins:
Due to the insolubility of retinoids, they are bound within the cell (or plasma) to specialized binding proteins. The sequestration of retinoids inside high-affinity binding-proteins increases their solubility, protects them from unfettered metabolism, and facilitates their transportation within the body, while still allowing access to the enzymes that metabolize them (e.g. the formation of retinyl esters) [Cowan93, Newcomer98]. Several retinoid-binding proteins exist. The cellular-retinol binding proteins (encoded by RBP1 and RBP2) bind free retinol within the cell, and continue to bind it even after it has been oxidized to retinal. RBP2 is expressed only in the small intestine, where it is involved in binding the retinol freshly obtained from dietary input. RBP1 is the main retinoid-binding protein in other cells, and also serves an a sensor for retinol availability, modulating activity of several retinol-metabolizing enzymes. The interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, encoded by RBP3, shuttles retinoids between the pigment epithelium and the visual pigments in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. The plasma retinol-binding protein ( RBP4) delivers retinol form liver storage to the peripheral tissues. The retinaldehyde-binding protein 1 ( RLBP1) binds different forms of retinal and is essential for the proper function of both rod and cone photoreceptors.

Initial Synthesis of all-trans-retinol

There are two dietary inputs of retinoids. Ingested retinyl-esters are broken in the intestine into all-trans-retinol, which is immediately bound to a cellular-retinol-binding protein. Ingested carotenoids are processed by ¦Â,¦Â-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase into all-trans-retinal, which is reduced to all-trans-retinol by several dehydrogenases and processed in the same way.

Storage:
After binding to a cellular-retinol-binding protein, all-trans-retinol is esterified by lecithin retinol acyltransferase ( LRAT) with long chain fatty acids, primarily palmitate, to form retinyl esters that are incorporated into the hydrophobic core of chylomicrons (large lipoprotein particles that transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body). The chylomicrons are secreted into the lymph and ultimately enter the blood via the thoracic and other lymphatic ducts. Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver and the retinyl esters are stored. When needed, these esters are hydrolyzed to regenerate the retinol.

Regeneration:
When the concentration of retinoids falls, the retinyl esters in the liver are hydrolyzed by neutral and acid retinyl ester hydrolases, such as liver carboxylesterase 1 monomer ( CES1), releasing all-trans-retinol [Linke05]. The retinol is transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it binds to plasma retinol-binding protein ( RBP4) and is secreted into the circulation as an all-trans-retinol-(plasma-retinol-binding-protein) complex.

Utilization:
All-trans-retinol is utilized mostly for production of 11-cis-retinal and all-trans-retinoate. These processes are described in the visual cycle I (vertebrates) and retinoate biosynthesis I pathways.",NA,

The source of the chromophore in the visual system is all-trans-retinol, derived from the blood circulation (see retinol biosynthesis for its synthesis). The compound is taken up from the choroid blood vessels into the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, a monolayer of epithelial cells adjacent to the outer segments of photoreceptors. In the RPE all-trans-retinol is converted in several steps to 11-cis-retinal, which is then introduced into the photoreceptors, where it combines with opsin to form the visual pigments.

Following photoactivation of the pigment, the chromophore is released as all-trans-retinal, which is reduced to all-trans-retinol and then removed from the bleached photoreceptors and transported back to the RPE, where it enters the cycle again. Since the supply of new all-trans-retinol from blood vessels is rather slow, the cycle is driven primarily by the recycled photolytic all-trans-retinol released from the bleached photoreceptors.

This process is known as the visual cycle, and it provides 11-cis-retinal for pigment regeneration in both rods and cones.

About This Pathway:
When all-trans-retinol arrives in the blood, it is bound as an all-trans-retinol-(plasma-retinol-binding-protein) complex. Upon entering the RPE cells, retinol dissociates from the plasma retinol-binding protein (which remains outside the cells) and binds instead to the cellular retinol-binding protein 1 ( RBP1), which diffuses from the apical processes to the RPE cell body. Once there, it is esterified to all-trans retinyl ester by the enzyme lecithin retinol acyltransferase ( LRAT). The ester is then hydrolyzed and isomerized into 11-cis-retinol in a single reaction catalyzed by the enzyme retinoid/lutein isomerohydrolase ( RPE65).

Bound to another protein called cellular retinaldehyde binding protein ( RLBP1), 11-cis-retinol is oxidized into 11-cis-retinal by 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase ( RDH5). Still bound to RLBP, 11-cis-retinal diffuses to the apical processes of RPE cells, which are close to the photoreceptors outer segments. At the apical processes 11-cis-retinal exits the RPE to the extracellular interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), possibly facilitated by RLBP and other proteins. Binding with another carrier protein, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), 11-cis-retinal is transferred back to the photoreceptor outer segment, where it recombines with apo-opsin to regenerate the visual pigment.

Photon absorption by 11-cis-retinal converts it to the all-trans form, which is a strong agonist for opsin. The photoisomerization of the retinoid induces a series of rapid conformational changes of the pigment molecule that convert it to the physiologically active state ( Meta II) within ~1 milisecond. Meta II is the form of rhodopsin that activates the visual G-protein, transducin, triggering a second messenger cascade. Meta II decays to an inactive form, Meta III, and following the hydrolysis of the Schiff-base bond dissociates into free opsin and all-trans-retinal. This decay takes minutes in rods but only seconds in cones. The released all-trans-retinal is reduced to all-trans-retinol by several NADPH-dependent retinol dehydrogenases, and all-trans-retinol is transferred from the photoreceptors to the apical processes of the RPE cells in a process facilitated by the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). In the RPE, all-trans-retinol binds to the Cellular Retinol Binding Protein and re-enters the cycle.",NA,

All-trans retinoic acid, one of the forms of vitamin A, is a metabolite of all-trans-retinol that mediates the functions of vitamin A required for growth and development, and is required in all chordate animals. During early embryonic development, retinoic acid generated in a specific region of the embryo helps determine position along the embryonic anterior/posterior axis by serving as an intercellular signaling molecule that guides development of the posterior portion of the embryo [Duester08]. It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages [Holland07].

In the adult, the normal growth and differentiation of the epidermis require an adequate supply of all-trans-retinoate, which is responsible for most of the activity of vitamin A, save visual pigment effects which require all-trans-retinal (see pathway the visual cycle I (vertebrates)), and some cell metabolism effects that may require all-trans-retinol. Retinoic acid controls the expression of retinoid-responsive genes via interactions of the retinoic acid/nuclear receptor complexes at specific DNA sequences in their control regions.

About This Pathway:
In non-ocular tissues all-trans-retinoate is produced from all-trans-retinol, which arrives to the tissues via blood, bound to a plasma retinol-binding protein. Upon entering the cell retinol dissociates from this carrier protein, which remains outside the cell, and immediately binds to the intercellular cellular retinol-binding protein 1.

All-trans-retinoate is produced from all-trans-retinol in two sequential oxidation steps, via all-trans-retinal. Once formed, it cannot be reduced back to retinol.

Several retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) enzymes, members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) gene superfamily, catalyze the first and rate-limiting step that generates all-trans-retinal [Wang11d]. Several observations suggest that the reaction is catalyzed while the substrate is bound to the cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (holo-CRBP1). These SDR enzymes display NADP or NAD cofactor preference and a substrate preference (all-trans- or cis-retinol substrates) [Haeseleer02]. Mutations in different enzymes result in distinct phenotypes, suggesting that each of them fulfills a specific function that cannot be supported by the others.

Once all-trans-retinal is generated, it is subsequently oxidized to form all-trans-retinoate. This activity is known to be mediated by the three members of the RALDH family, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3 [Niederreither97]. As with the RDH enzymes, mutations in different retinal dehydrogenases result in distinct phenotypes, suggesting that each of them fulfills a distinct role [Napoli11].",NA,

About This Pathway:
The cytosolic enzyme xanthine oxidase (which also exists in a second form known as xanthine dehydrogenase) generates all-trans-retinoate from all-trans-retinol in human mammary epithelial cells. The substrate must be bound to a cellular-retinol-binding protein.

Both forms of the protein can form retinoate, although via different mechanisms. The xanthine dehydrogenase form can generate all-trans-retinoate directly, as shown here [Taibi08]. The xanthine oxidase form catalyzes two reactions - the oxidation of an all-trans retinol-[cellular-retinol-binding-protein] to an all-trans retinal-[cellular-retinol-binding-protein], followed by oxidation of the latter to all-trans-retinoate [Taibi01, Taibi07].

This biological significance of this observation is not completely understood, but it may represent a cytosolic pathway for production of all-trans-retinoate. It has been reported that 6 to 20% of cellular retinal-generating capacity occurs in the cytosol [Napoli11].",NA,

Thiamine diphosphate, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and ¦Á-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [Lawhorn04]. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamien-containing husk [Begley96]. Thiamine is synthesized de novo by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. Plasmodium <Plasmodium>), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.

About This Pathway:
The active form of thiamine is thiamine diphosphate. The non-phosphorylated form thiamine is not produced as an intermediate in the de novo biosynthetic route in bacteria, but is found in the environment as a degradation product.

Many microbes possess transporters that allow them to import thiamine [Schyns05], as well as salvage pathways that regenerate the active form. One such pathway, which is described here, consists of the direct conversion of thiamine to thiamine diphosphate [Melnick04].

This single-step thiamin salvage pathway was originally thought to occur only in eukaryotes, but the discovery of the enzyme in Bacillus subtilis revealed that it is also used by bacteria.",NA,

Pyrimidine and purine nucleotides are found in all living organisms. They are essential components of nucleic acids, and play a crucial role in growth, development and reproduction, as well as in a large number of essential metabolic progressions such as interconversions from sugars to polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids [Zhou98, Giermann02, Schroder05, Zrenner06].

The de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (see UMP biosynthesis I) converts hydrogencarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-¦Á-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to UMP (UMP). This pathway appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. UMP is subsequently converted to other pyrimidines, as described in this pathway.

About This Pathway:
The de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides starts with UMP, and proceeds via UDP to UTP. CTP is only formed de novo by deamination of UTP.

The first enzyme of the pathway, UMP kinase, catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP. The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named UMP/CMP kinase [Okada04].

The next enzyme in the pathway, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the terminal phosphate of a nucleoside-triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside-diphosphate - in this case, the transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana the enzyme is encoded by a small gene family and has been demonstrated to mediate polar auxin transport [Choi05a] and interact with other proteins conferring stress tolerance [Moon03a].

In humans the conversion of 2'-deoxyuridine to uracil can be performed by uridine phosphorylase 1, which also accepts uridine but not thymidine. The nucleobases that are formed by the phosphorylases can be degraded further as described in thymine degradation and uracil degradation I (reductive), or reused to synthesize a new nucleoside.",NA,

Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates dCTP and dTTP are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates CTP and UTP are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as UDP-¦Á-D-glucose, CMP-3-deoxy-¦Â-D-manno-octulosonate and dTDP-¦Á-D-fucopyranose, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids [Zhou98, Giermann02, Schroder05, Zrenner06].

In addition to de novo biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the de novo biosynthesis pathways (see pyrimidine ribonucleosides salvage I, pyrimidine nucleobases salvage I and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides salvage). The de novo biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the de novo biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the de novo pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level. These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

About This Pathway:
The pathway shown here illustrates the most common route in which pyrimidine ribonucleotides ( CDP and UDP) are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, and the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate dTTP is formed. It is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. The pathway also includes EC 3.6.1.15, nucleoside-triphosphate phosphatase, which is found in eukaryotes and some bacteria. However, many bacterial species lack this enzyme and form CDP in other routes.

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of de novo biosynthesis, UMP, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to UDP followed by reduction to dUDP. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed de novo, CTP, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to CDP followed by reduction to dCDP.

Formation of the DNA-specific end product dTTP requires reductive methylation of dUMP to dTMP by 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate catalyzed by thymidylate synthase, EC 2.1.1.45 (some organisms have an alternative enzyme, as described in pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis III). The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form dUMP. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, dUDP, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form before it can be reduced/methylated. This is achieved in two steps - phosphorylation to dUTP, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in dUMP.

Once dTMP is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form dTTP. The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific thymidylate kinase, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase.

In organisms that contain the enzyme dCTP deaminase ( EC 3.5.4.13), a second route forms dUMP from dCDP (see pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis II).",NA,

The de novo pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis produces only the uridine ribonucleotide UMP. All other ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides have to be derived from that nucleotide. Neither UMP nor UDP can be directly converted to CMP or CDP, respectively. The only uridine-based nucleotide that can be converted to a cytidine-based nucleotide is the triphosphate form UTP. Thus the conversion of uridine-based nucleotides to cytidine-based nucleotides involves the phosphorylation of the de novo-synthesized UMP to UTP and its conversion to CTP (see UTP and CTP de novo biosynthesis). Since the mono- and diphosphate forms are essential for protein and lipid glycosylation reactions (for example, in compounds such as CDP-glycerol and CMP-3-deoxy-¦Â-D-manno-octulosonate), nucleotide triphosphates need to be dephosphorylated to the mono- and diphosphate forms.

There are many enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and amination of pyrimidine nucleotides, and these enzymes are often restricted to specific taxonomic groups. Thus, several pathway variants exist in MetaCyc to describe these transformations.

About This Pathway:
This pathway is predicted to occur only in eukaryotes and thermophilic bacteria and archaea, since one of its key enzymes, EC 3.6.1.15, nucleoside-triphosphatase, is not present in mesophilic bacteria (note that in this pathway display, the reactions of this enzyme are actually labeled as [EC 3.6.1.5]). This enzyme removes the terminal phosphate group from nucleoside triphosphates, generating the corresponding diphophates.

Even though the enzymes EC 6.3.4.2, CTP synthase (glutamine hydrolysing), CTP synthase, and EC 3.1.3.5, 5¡ä-nucleotidase, 5¡ä-nucleotidase, have not been studied in plants at this time, they are predicted to function in them [Zrenner06].",NA,

The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates ( UTP and CTP) can be synthesized either de novo (see superpathway of pyrimidine ribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases ( uracil and cytosine) or their nucleosides ( uridine and cytidine) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters [Griffith96, Mourad12, Choi12]. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development [Mainguet09] and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning [Chen11a]. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants [Mainguet09]. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain de novo pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis [Barsotti02, Cao05, Cansev06].

Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.

About This Pathway:
The key enzyme in this salvage pathway is uridine-cytidine kinase (also known as uridine kinase, EC 2.7.1.48). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the nucleosides uridine and cytidine to their monophosphate forms.

The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, although some differences exists among the enzymes. For example, the enzyme from Escherichia coli prefers GTP as the phosphate donor [ValentinHansen78], while the mammalian enzyme prefers ATP. The enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana are dual-domain proteins, with the second domain resembling EC 2.4.2.9, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, although they were shown to lack such activity [Mainguet09].

Another enzyme that participates in the salvage of nucleosides is cytidine deaminase ( EC 3.5.4.5). It has been shown in Escherichia coli that exogenously supplied cytidine is not directly converted to CMP. Instead, a very active cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase converts it rapidly to uridine, which is phosphorylated to UMP, and eventually converted to UTP and CTP. However, exogenously supplied cytidine will be phosphorylated to CMP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation [Neidhardt96].

This pathway was shown to be the exclusive pyrimidine ribonucleoside salvage pathway operating in potato tubers [Katahira02].",NA,

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised de novo at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2'-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis I). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase.

The de novo synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides.

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair [Mann88, Bjorklund90]. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development [Mainguet09] and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning [Chen11a].

The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells [Plagemann88]. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.

About This Pathway:
Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21), (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74). This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria [Rima77], mammals [Arner95], and plants [Clausen12].

Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans deoxycytidine kinase is encoded by the DCK gene, while two isozymes, encoded by TK1 and TK2, catalyze thymidine kinase activity [Hershfield82, Cory93]. Arabidopsis thaliana posseses two thymidine kinase genes ( TK1a and TK1b), and a broad substrate range deoxynucleoside kinase encoded by a single DNK gene that can phosphorylate both 2'-deoxyuridine and 2'-deoxycytidine [Clausen12]. Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Typhi, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine [EcoSal]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.

In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how 2'-deoxycytidine can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to 2'-deoxyuridine, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to dTMP by the action of thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45).

Once formed, the monophosphates are phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis. dTMP is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9), while dCMP is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14) and in prokaryotes by a dedicated (d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25). Both diphosphates, dUDP and dCDP, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6).",NA,

About This Pathway:
While de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides starts with UMP (see pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis I, some organisms utilize this salvage pathway to generate dTTP from CTP.

The key enzyme of the pathway is deoxycytidylate deaminase (dCMP deaminase) ( EC 3.5.4.12). This allosteric enzyme, which is found in Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and metazoa, catalyzes the deamination of dCMP to form dUMP, thus providing the nucleotide substrate for thymidylate synthase ( EC 2.1.1.45).

While another allosteric enzyme, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.1) (RNR), plays an essential role in the de novo biosynthesis of all four dNTPs required for DNA synthesis, dCMP deaminase is specifically involved in the production of dTTP. The enzyme is allosterically activated by dCTP and inhibited by dTTP, and is thus regulated by the ratio of dCTP to dTTP in the cell [Sanchez12]. Both dCTP and dTTP appear to bind a single allosteric site located far from the active site, and Mg2+ is involved in their binding [Maley82].

The actual reduction of a ribonucleotide to a deoxyribonucleotide (CDP to dCDP in this case) is catalyzed by the rate-limiting EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase. This enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can perform the reduction of only the diphosphate form of ribonucleosides.

GMP is phosphorylated to GDP and subsequently to GTP by the enzymes guanylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively.

About This Pathway:

The salvage of purine deoxynucleosides to deoxynucleotides is common, but not universal. For example, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have the enzymes that phosphorylate purine deoxynucleosides to deoxynucleoside monophopsphates, and thus is not able to utilize this salvage pathway.Mammalian cells contain four principal nucleoside kinase salvage enzymes, namely deoxycytidine kinase ( DCK, EC 2.7.1.74), thymidine kinases 1 and 2 ( TK1 and TK2, EC 2.7.1.21), and deoxyguanosine kinase ( DGUOK, EC 2.7.1.113). In addition, adenosine kinase ( ADK, EC 2.7.1.20) should also be considered a deoxyribonucleoside salvage enzyme, because it is can phosphorylate 2'-deoxyadenosine, although with much lower efficiency that the other enzymes [Arner95].

The phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in mammalian cells is mediated predominantly by two of these enzymes, the cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase ( DCK) and the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase ( DGUOK). The mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. It phosphorylate 2'-deoxyguanosine and 2'-deoxyinosine with high affinity (Km < 25 ¦ÌM) and 2'-deoxyadenosine with lower affinity (Km > 60 ¦ÌM) [Yamada82].Despite of its name, deoxycytidine kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of not only 2'-deoxycytidine but also 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine [Sarup87, Arner95].The enzyme can utilize either ATP or UTP as phosphoryl donors, and based on comparison of in vitro kinetic data of cytarabine phosphorylation by both compounds it has been suggested that UTP is the in vivo relevant donor [White91, Shewach92].

While there do not appear to exist dedicated enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates to the diphosphate form, the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of ribonucleoside monophosphates, namely adenylate kinase ( EC 2.7.4.3) and guanylate kinase ( EC 2.7.4.8), appear to also catalyze the reaction with the deoxynucleotides in all species studied so far [Van].Once the diphosphate forms are generated, they are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) [Jong91, Postel02].

These molecules have been reported to be involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking [Saiardi02], transcription [El03], chemotaxis [Luo03], telomere maintenance [York05, Saiardi05], apoptosis [Nagata05, Morrison01], and DNA repair [Luo02], and to mediate environmental stress responses [Dubois02, Pesesse04, Safrany04, Choi05].

The concentration of the molecules appear to be tightly regulated with an extremely rapid turnover [Burton09a]. By inhibiting the enzymes that remove the pyrophosphate groups (encoded by NUDT3, NUDT4, NUDT10 and NUDT11) it was possible to calculate that their cellular pools were normally turning over at least 10 times every 40 min [Glennon93].

The pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates has been illucidated. Two main classes of enzymes are involved: 5-kinases (encoded by IP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3) [Saiardi99, Saiardi01a] and 1/3 kinases (encoded by PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2) [Mulugu07, Lin09].

All of these enzymes can phosphorylate phytate, generating either 1D-myoinositol 5-diphosphate 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (in the case of IP6K) or a mixture of 1D-myo-inositol 1-diphosphate 2,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and 1D-myo-inositol 3-diphosphate 1,2,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (in the case of PPIP5K). These compounds, which contain a single pyrophosphate, are also known simply as InsP7. In addition, each enzyme class can continue to phosphorylate the product of the other enzyme class, resulting in a mixture of 1D-myo-inositol 1,5-bis(diphosphate) 2,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate and 3,5-bisdiphosphoinositol-1D-myo-inositol 2,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate, also known as InsP8 [Lin09].

Another inositol pyrophosphate that is found in cells is a diphospho-1D-myo-inositol tetrakisphosphate, whose exact stereomeric structure has not been defined yet. This compound is synthesized from D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate by the three IP6K [Saiardi00], as well as the inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate 5-kinase ( IPMK) [Saiardi01].",NA,

Progesterone is the major naturally occurring human progestogen.

In animals, progesterone is produced in the ovaries (by the corpus luteum), the adrenal glands, and, during pregnancy, in the placenta. In addition, progesterone is also produced by some plant species, such as Juglans regia [Pauli10]

Like other steroid hormones, progresterone is synthesized from pregnenolone, which in turn is made from cholesterol (see pregnenolone biosynthesis). The conversion is carried out in two separate, sequential reactions, first the dehydrogenation of the 3¦Â-hydroxy steroid, producing pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione, followed by an isomerization to progesterone [Thomas95].

Steroid hormones are divided into five groups based on the receptors to which they bind: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens. Certain vitamin D derivatives (e.g. calcitriol) are sometimes considered a sixth steroid hormone group.

The natural steroid hormones of mammals are generally synthesized from cholesterol in the gonads and adrenal glands. Cholesterol is released from lipid droplets or endosomes and transported to the mitochondria by carrier proteins. The rate limiting step for steroid hormone synthesis is the transport of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) [Miller07].

Once in the mitochondrial inner membrane cholesterol is converted in the into the pre-hormone pregnenolone in three distinct reactions all catalyzed by a single cytochrome P450 encoded by CYP11A1.

pregnenolone can be metabolized to either the progestogen progesterone or the androgen androstenedione as described in the pathways progesterone biosynthesis and androgen biosynthesis, respectively.

The inverted m7G structure, also known as cap0, marks transcription start sites and has multiple effects on gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation initiation, as facilitated by interactions with nuclear and cytoplasmic cap binding proteins [Izaurralde94, Kuge98, Schroeder04, Gingras99, Chu08].

The cap structure is formed cotranscriptionally by the sequential action of three enzymes. The first step is the hydrolysis of the 5'-triphosphate terminus of a nascent pre-mRNA to a diphosphate, catalyzed by EC 3.1.3.33, polynucleotide 5¡ä-phosphatase (often referred to as RNA triphosphatase). The diphosphate RNA end is capped with GMP by EC 2.7.7.50, mRNA guanylyltransferase, to yield a GpppNpNp- structure, also known as capG, and finally capG is methylated by EC 2.1.1.56, mRNA (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase to yield a cap0 structure. While in some cases (e.g. Vaccinia virus) a multifunctional polypeptide contains all three active sites, in other cases (e.g. fungi) each function is catalyzed by a different polypeptide.

In many eukaryotes the small nuclear (sn) RNAs involved in splicing also receive cotranscriptional cap0. However, following the formation of cap0 they are modified further by hypermethylation of m7G, forming m2,2,7G (trimethylguanosine or TMG), a reaction catalyzed in the cytoplasm by trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (Tgs1).

In higher eukaryotes, including insects, vertebrates and their viruses, further modification of mRNAs and snRNAs 5' ends involves the 2'-O-ribose methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide, catalyzed by EC 2.1.1.57, methyltransferase cap1 (see mRNA capping II). The structure that includes a cap0 and the 2'-O-ribose methylation is called cap1. In about 50% of the mRNAs the second nucleotide is also methylated at the same position by a different enzyme, forming cap2 [Werner11].",NA,

Glycosylation is one of the major types of post-translational modification of proteins, and is an essential process in all eukaryotes. Protein glycosylation is known to be involved in cellular targeting and secretion, and helps to regulate enzymatic activity, confer enhanced stability and solubility to secreted proteins, and affect the functionality of proteins in the immune system. In addition, glycoproteins participate in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.

The two major types of protein glycosylation are known as N-linked and O-linked glycosylation. O-linked oligosaccharides are variously attached to L-serine or L-threonine residues in the target proteins. Most commonly O-glycosylation begins with the attachment of N-acetyl-¦Á-D-galactosamine to the free hydroxyl group of the amino acid, although O-linkages to fucose, glucose, mannose, xylose and other sugars are known.

About This Pathway:
Mucin-type O-glycosylation, consisting of glycans attached via O-linked N-acetyl-¦Á-D-galactosamine to L-serine or L-threonine residues, is one of the most abundant forms of protein glycosylation in animals.

Initiation of glycosylation occurs in the Golgi, after the target proteins have been completely folded. Initiation is followed by the action of numerous very specific glycosyltransferases, resulting in the extension of N-acetyl-¦Á-D-galactosamine into numerous different O-glycan structures [Tarp08, Tian09]. Eight different core structures of mucin-type O-glycans have been described, many with the same monosaccharide residues in different linkages. In humans typically only core 1 and core 2 structures are found. Core 1 glycans are small glycans that are often terminated with sialic acid by EC 2.4.3.4, ¦Â-galactoside ¦Á-2,3-sialyltransferase, whereas core 2 glycans have the potential to be elaborated into larger glycans [Jensen10].

Protein glycosylation pathways are usually controlled by the genes that encode the enzymes responsible for the initiation of glycosylation. In mucin-type O-glycosylation, there is a great abundance of such genes (up to 20 homologous genes) encoding EC 2.4.1.41, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (only a single representative of these genes is shown in this MetaCyc pathway). These genes are differentially expressed over tissue and developmental phase, enabling complex and strict regulation [Bennett12]. In addition, many have clear specificities for the sites of attachment, thus determining the density and site occupancy of the mucin-type O-glycosylation [Clausen96, Ten03].",NA,

A great diversity of oligosaccharide structures and types of glycoconjugates is found in nature, and this diversity is the result of the actions of a large number of glycosyltransferase enzymes.

Glycosyltransferases have high donor and acceptor substrate specificities, and are in general limited to catalysis of one unique glycosidic linkage. The formation of many glycosidic linkages is covered by large homologous glycosyltransferase gene families, and in many cases multiple enzyme isoforms in each family provide a degree of redundancy as well as a higher level of regulation of the glycoforms synthesized [Amado99]. In this MetaCyc pathway we show only a representative enzyme for each type.

The glycosyltrasnferase field progressed slowly for a long time due to the inherent problems associated with the isolation of these proteins, which are often large membrane proteins with overlapping activities. The introduction of the transfection cloning strategy in 1990 provided a major breakthrough, since it enables the isolation of the encoding gene without the need to purify the enzyme [Ernst89, Rajan89].

EC 2.4.1.38, ¦Â-N-acetylglucosaminylglycopeptide ¦Â-1,4-galactosyltransferase, was the first mammalian glycosyltransferase that was cloned [Shaper86, Narimatsu86, Shaper88, DAgostaro89]. It was followed by EC 2.4.99.1, ¦Â-galactoside ¦Á-2,6-sialyltransferase [Weinstein87], EC 2.4.1.69, galactoside 2-¦Á-L-fucosyltransferase [Rajan89], EC 2.4.1.87, N-acetyllactosaminide 3-¦Á-galactosyltransferase [Joziasse89] and EC 2.4.1.40, glycoprotein-fucosylgalactoside ¦Á-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase [Yamamoto90]. At this point it became clear that the primary sequences of glycosyltransferases that catalyze different functions were entirely different. However, once a gene encoding a new type of glycosyltransferase has been cloned, its sequence was used successfully for the discovery of other members of this gene family. For example, six additional human ¦Â-4Gal-T genes (EC 2.4.1.38) designated ¦Â4Gal-T2 to -T7 were identified and shown to be functional [Almeida97, Schwientek98, Sato98, Almeida99].

EC 2.4.1.150, N-acetyllactosaminide ¦Â-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase, is also known as the ""blood group I"" enzyme. The i antigen is found on membrane proteins in red blood cells and many other cell types as well as various body secretions of developing fetuses and newborn infants [Marsh61, Marsh68], while the I antigen is found in in all adults [Wiener56]. The i antigen undergoes gradual conversion to the I antigen in newborn infants, a process dependent on expression of EC 2.4.1.150. Complete conversion of the antigen is usually acheived by the age of 18 months [Piller84].",NA,

In most cases other sugars are added to this galactosamine residue, resulting in glycosidic chains of variable lengths. Among O-GalNAc glycosylated proteins, mucins are the most ubiquitous. That type of glycosylation is described in other pathways, such as mucin core 1 and core 2 O-glycosylation and mucin core 3 and core 4 O-glycosylation.

However, it has been subsequently found that in all eukaryotic systems L-serine or L-threonine residues of some proteins are also modified with a ¦Â-linked N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine [Torres84] that is not elongated to more complex structures [Hart96]. This type of glycosylation is ubiquitous and abundant on nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins of virtually all eukaryotes, including protozoans [OrtegaBarria90, Stanley95] and fungi [Machida94]. More than 400 proteins are known to be modified in this manner, including RNA polymerase II and its transcription factors, nuclear pore proteins, viral proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, tumor suppressor proteins, and oncoproteins [Zachara09].

The O-[N-acetyl]-glucosylation is highly dynamic, with turnover rates much higher than those of the the protein backbones [Kearse91, Chou92, Roquemore96]. In addition, the glucosylation is often associated with phosphorylation, and sometimes the phosphate groups and the NAcGlc groups occupy the same hydroxyl groups [Kelly93, Chou95, Comer00]. These observations lead to the conclusion that O-[N-acetyl]-glucosylation serves a regulatory role, controlling protein phosphorylation and protein multimerization [Hart95, Hart95a]. Glycosylation generally promotes the associations with other proteins, while phosphorylation favor disassociation.

The modified proteins, which are involved in regulation processes of the cell, can exhibit reciprocal O-GlcNAc glycosylation and phosphorylation during the cell cycle, cell stimulation, and/or cell growth [Hart96, Hart97]. Glycosylation appears to be involved in mediating cytoskeletal assembly and organization [Dong93, Ding96].

The enzyme that attaches the N-acetyl-¦Á-D-glucosamine moiety to the proteins is EC 2.4.1.255, protein O-GlcNAc transferase. Deletion of the OGT gene that encodes it is lethal [Haltiwanger92, Kreppel97].

The N-acetylglucosamine residues are not extended into longer structures, and are removed from the modified proteins by EC 3.2.1.169, protein O-GlcNAcase. While there may be multiple proteins that catalyze this activity, it has been well documented as one of the activities of the bifunctional protein O-GlcNAcase/histone acetyltransferase [Gao01, Wells02].",NA,

Taurine is a sulfonated amino acid. The name comes from Taurus (Latin for bull), as it was first isolated from ox bile. It is found in high abundance in the tissues of many animals (especially sea animals) and, in lesser abundance, in plants, fungi, and some bacterial species.

Taurine plays several important roles in mammals and is essential to newborns of many species. The main functions of taurine in mammals include bile acid conjugation, detoxification, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

Taurine is produced from L-cysteine in multiple pathways. Two pathways have been described in mammals: the ""cysteinesulfinate pathway"" (see taurine biosynthesis I), which proceeds via 3-sulfino-L-alanine and hypotaurine [Jacobsen68], and the ""cysteamine pathway"" (see taurine biosynthesis II), which proceeds via (R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl-L-cysteine, cysteamine, and hypotaurine [Cavallini76, Scandurra78]. A third pathway that involves sulfite (see taurine biosynthesis III) has been described from Sauropsida [Malatesta20].

About This Pathway:
EC 6.3.2.51, phosphopantothenate¡ªcysteine ligase (ATP), a key member of the coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway, produces (R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl-L-cysteine. It has been shown that this compound can be subject to a hydrolysis/decarboxylation reaction that produces cysteamine [Cavallini76]. This compound is then converted to hypotaurine by EC 1.13.11.19, cysteamine dioxygenase [Dominy07].

Hypotaurine exists in low concentrations in liver and brain of adult mammals, and at least 90% of it is readily oxidized to taurine [Osman97]. The evidence for an enzyme that is responsible for this conversion was controversial for 55 years [Sumizu62, Fiori69, Oja73, Oja81, Kontro85] until it was shown in 2020 that the reaction is catalyzed by FMO1, one of the isozymes of EC 1.14.13.8, flavin-containing monooxygenase [Veeravalli20].",NA,

Purine nucleotides participate in many aspects of cellular metabolism including the structure of DNA and RNA, serving as enzyme cofactors, functioning in cellular signaling, acting as phosphate group donors, and generating cellular energy [Carter08]. Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of purine nucleotides is critical to normal function [Zhang08]. This occurs through a combination of de novo purine biosynthesis and superpathway of purine nucleotide salvage [Zhao13a]. The de novo purine biosynthesis is more energy consuming than the purine salvage pathway.

About this Pathway:

The de novo biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary. The pathway forms IMP from PRPP and glutamine using several molecules of ATP in ten enzymatic reactions [Ng10]. The reactions of this pathway are catalyzed by ten separate enzymes in most prokaryotes [Senecoff96]. However, in humans the ten highly conserved steps leading to IMP synthesis are catalyzed by just six enzymes, including one trifunctional and two bifunctional enzymes.

This pathway shows the additional steps downstream of IMP leading to the formation of GTP, dGTP, ATP and dATP.

Fluorescent microscopy studies on cancer cells has shown that the six proteins of the pathway leading upto the formation of IMP, assemble in a functional multienzyme complex termed the ""purinosome"", within the cytoplasm [An08]. This complex is dynamically reversible [Deng12]. Further investigation of the purinosome has shed light on some of the accessory proteins that may aid purinosome assembly and hence de novo purine biosynthesis, which include protein kinases and heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 [An10][French13].

The cytosolic purinosome clusters associate with microtubule filaments not connected with the actin network. Nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule formation, disrupted purinosomes formation and decreased flux through the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway [An10a].

Rapidly dividing cells favor the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, and it has long been considered an ideal target for anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial chemotherapeutics. Folates are required cofactors for many of the enzymes of purine biosynthesis, and anti-folates have also gained widespread use as chemotherapeutic agents to disrupt the pathway [Zhao13a].

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised de novo at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2'-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis I). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase.

The de novo synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides.

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair [Mann88, Bjorklund90]. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development [Mainguet09] and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning [Chen11a].

The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells [Plagemann88]. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.

About This Pathway:
Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21) (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74). This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria [Rima77], mammals [Arner95], and plants [Clausen12].

Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans deoxycytidine kinase is encoded by the DCK gene, while two isozymes, encoded by TK1 and TK2, catalyze thymidine kinase activity [Hershfield82, Cory93].

Arabidopsis thaliana posseses two thymidine kinase genes ( TK1a and TK1b), and a broad substrate range deoxynucleoside kinase encoded by a single DNK gene that can phosphorylate both 2'-deoxyuridine and 2'-deoxycytidine [Clausen12].

Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Typhi, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine [EcoSal]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.

In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how 2'-deoxycytidine can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to 2'-deoxyuridine, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to dTMP by the action of thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45).",NA,

It can also be derived from dietary intake, protein degradation and phospholipid degradation. It is not only used in protein synthesis, but also as a precursor for the biosynthesis of glycine ( glycine/serine biosynthesis), cysteine, tryptophan, and phospholipids. In addition, it directly or indirectly serves as a source of one-carbon units for the biosynthesis of various other compounds [Baek03]. In the mammalian nervous system, L-serine is converted to D-serine by serine racemase. D-serine is a co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors, a major neurotransmitter receptor family, that require coactivation [Kim02d].

Mammals can synthesize glycine via at least three different pathways. The glycine produced can be used in serine biosynthesis as shown in the reverse reaction of this pathway [Schlupen03]. It can also be used in the biosynthesis of other compounds such as tetrapyrroles and purines, see tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and purine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis. Along with serine, glycine is an important donor of one-carbon hydroxymethyl groups via the tetrahydrofolate pathways, as shown in pathways folate polyglutamylation and folate transformations I.

The thiol redox system of Escherichia coli consists of the thioredoxin pathway (shown here) and the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway (see glutathione-glutaredoxin redox reactions). Electrons from NADPH flow through these pathways via gradients in redox potentials. Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin reduce disulfide bonds by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism involving two active site cysteine residues in the motif CXXC (where X is any amino acid) that form either a disulfide or a dithiol. In addition to the importance of thiol redox potential [Mossner99], other important factors in the thiol redox system are cellular location [Debarbieux98] and the overall redox state of the cell. Both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways appear to operate in parallel. Genetic studies in Escherichia coli have shown the two pathways to be functionally redundant during aerobic growth, although inactivation of both pathways results in unviability. Reviewed in [Toledano07, VlamisGardikas08, Ritz01a].

The thioredoxin pathway is involved in reducing important cytoplasmic enzymes such as the essential ribonucleotide reductase, as well as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B. Escherichia coli thioredoxin also binds to bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and serves as its processivity factor for polymerization during phage growth ( [Etson10] and in [Doublie98]). In addition, many other proteins that may interact with thioredoxin have been identified [Leichert04, Kumar04a]. Thioredoxin is also involved in a pathway for the trans-membrane transfer of reducing potential from the cytoplasm to the periplasm to reduce the protein disulfide isomerase DbsC [Rietsch97, Cho09]. After acting as a reductant, disulfide-containing oxidized thioredoxin is reduced back to a dithiol by thioredoxin reductase, an FAD-containing, NADPH-dependent enzyme. Reviewed in [Toledano07].

The thiol redox system is present in taxonomic groups from archaea to man. However, despite structural and mechanistic similariteis between prokaryotic and eukaryotic thiol redox systems, their overall cellular functions differ (reviewed in [Toledano07] and [Arner00]).

These proteins are the products of Escherichia coli genes trxC and trxA, respectively. Clicking on either of the instance names will display a page showing some structural and functional properties of the respective protein.

Again in the pathway diagram, clicking on the protein class named ""an oxidized thioredoxin"" will display a page showing two instances of this class named oxidized thioredoxin 1 and oxidized thioredoxin 2. Note that in the gene-reaction schematic shown on this page the reduced thioredoxins are considered to be the direct gene products and their oxidized forms are shown separately as modified forms of the gene products.

In Escherichia coli TrxA is a more well studied thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase than TrxC (Trx2). TrxC was identified later as a novel thioredoxin that forms a subfamily of the TrxA protein family. The gene encoding TrxC is under control of the transcriptional regulator OxyR which responds to oxidative stress, although the biological role of TrxC remains to be fully elucidated [MirandaVizuete97, Collet03].",NA,

In this pathway, UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is the amino sugar nucleotide donor of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues for the biosynthesis of glycosylated proteins and cell surface structures. In this pathway, fructose-6-phosphate produced during glycolysis (see pathway glycolysis I (from glucose 6-phosphate)) is transaminated and isomerized to glucosamine-6-phosphate, followed by acetylation to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate, isomerization to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate, and uridylation to UDP-GlcNAc.

This cytosolic pathway is highly regulated. UDP-GlcNAc donates GlcNAc residues for the biosynthesis of several classes of compounds, including N-linked glycans (see pathway protein N-glycosylation initial phase (eukaryotic)), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, glycolipids, and chitin, a homopolymer of GlcNac (in [Bulik03]).

UDP-GlcNAc can be converted to UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine by UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 4-epimerase. N-acetyl-D-galactosamine is a component of several different kinds of cell surface structures and glycosylated proteins (see pathway UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine biosynthesis I).

L-valine is one of the three main branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), along with L-leucine and L-isoleucine. The catabolic pathways of the BCAAs can be divided into two sequential series of reactions, referred to as the common pathway and the distal pathway.

The common pathway includes three enzymes that catalyze the conversion of all three BCAAs to their respective acyl-CoA derivatives ( methylacrylyl-CoA, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, and (E)-2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA for L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine, respectively), though the intermediates formed by these enzymes are different for the different amino acids. The distal parts of the pathway are completely different for the three BCAAs, and comprise enzymes specific for each amino acid.

About this Pathway:
The catabolism of L-valine involves its conversion via 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate to isobutanoyl-CoA by the L-valine aminotransferases [Naylor80]. The isobutanoyl-CoA is then desaturated to form the ¦Á,¦Â-unsaturated thioester methylacrylyl-CoA catalyzed by the branched-chain ¦Á-keto acid dehydrogenase complex [AEvarsson00].

Hydration to 3-hydroxy-isobutanoyl-CoA and thioester hydrolysis forms the diffusible and transportable compound 3-hydroxy-isobutanoate. In most tissues, 3-hydroxy-isobutanoate is oxidized to (S)-methylmalonate-semialdehyde. However, it can be released into the blood stream from some tissues and serve as a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis [Letto86].

The pathway spans both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. The first reaction takes place in the cytoplasm, and the product 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate is then transported into the mitochondria, where the remaining reactions occur.",NA,

In the early twentieth century, Otto Warburg established that there are fundamental differences in the central metabolic pathways operating in malignant tissue. He showed that cancer cells consume a large amount of glucose, maintain high rate of glycolysis and convert a majority of glucose into lactic acid even under normal oxygen concentrations (Warburg's Effects). More recently, it has been recognized that the 'Warburg effect' encompasses a similarly increased utilization of glutamine. From the intermediate molecules provided by enhanced glycolysis and glutaminolysis, cancer cells synthesize most of the macromolecules required for the duplication of their biomass and genome. These cancer-specific alterations represent a major consequence of genetic mutations and the ensuing changes of signalling pathways in cancer cells.

There are two different phases in the pathway. One is irreversible oxidative phase in which glucose-6P is converted to ribulose-5P by oxidative decarboxylation, and NADPH is generated [MD:M00006]. The other is reversible non-oxidative phase in which phosphorylated sugars are interconverted to generate xylulose-5P, ribulose-5P, and ribose-5P [MD:M00007]. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) formed from ribose-5P [MD:M00005] is an activated compound used in the biosynthesis of histidine and purine/pyrimidine nucleotides.

The cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 catalyzes conversion of cholesterol, a C27 compound, to the first C21 steroid, pregnenolone, which is converted by a bifunctional enzyme complex to the gestagen hormone, progesterone [MD:M00107]. Pregnenolone and progesterone are the starting materials for the three groups of steroids: C21 steroids of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, C19 steroids of androgens, and C18 steroids of estrogens. (i) Progesterone is converted by hydroxylations at carbons 21 and 11 to corticosterone, which is further modified by hydroxylation and oxydoreduction at carbon 18 to yield aldosterone, a mineralcorticoid [MD:M00108]. Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid, is formed from 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone with 11-deoxycortisol as an intermediate [MD:M00109]. (ii) Male hormone testosterone is formed from pregnenolone by two pathways, delta5 pathway via dehydroepiandrosterone and delta4 pathway via androstenedione [MD:M00110]. The enzyme CYP17A1 is responsible for the 17,20 lyase and 17alpha-hydroxylase activities in respective pathways. (iii) Female hormones estrone and estradiol are formed from testosterone and 4-androstene-3,17-dione by oxidative removal of the C19 methyl group and subsequent aromatization of ring A [MD:M00111]. In addition to these three groups, recent studies show that there is another group, termed neurosteroids, synthesized in the brain rather than the peripheral endocrine gland.",NA,

N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases [MD:M00055], the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation [DS:H00118?H00119].",NA,

Biosynthesis of O-glycans starts from the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine. The first GalNAc may be extended with sugars including galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, or sialic acid, but not mannose, glucose, or xylose. Depending on the sugars added, there are four common O-glycan core structures, cores 1 through 4, and an additional four, cores 5 though 8. Mucins are highly O-glycosylated glycoproteins ubiquitous in mucous secretions on cell surfaces and in body fluids. Mucin O-glycans can be branched, and many sugars or groups of sugars are antigenic.

Core M1 and M2 glycans can then be further attached by fucose residues, sialic acid terminals and sulfatded glucuroinc acid terminals. Core M3 glycan is involved in the synthesis of alpha-dystroglycan, a heavily glycosylated protein found in muscle and brain tissues. Core M3 glycan contains a tandem repeat of ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) and -alpha3-GlcA-beta3-Xyl- repeating structures. Defects of genes encoding core glycans and modified core M3 glycans are associated with various congenital diseases, such as muscular dystrophies caused by reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscles [DS:H00120].",NA,

Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit of beta-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) and beta-D-glucuronic acid (GlcA), and often modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates (IdoA). CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues [MD:M00057]. The assembly process of CS is initiated by transferring GalNAc residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) possessing both beta 1,3 glucuronosyltransferase and beta 1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities [MD:M00058]. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor.

In these sugar residues, sulfation modification may be performed at various positions. Structural studies show that Hep possesses a higher degree of sulfation than HS. The biosynthesis of HS/Hep occurs with the addition of the first GlcNAc residue by EXTL3 glycosyltransferase after completion of tetrasaccharide linkage region attached to serine residue of a core protein. The chain polymeraization is then catalyzed by EXT1 and EXT2 transferases. As the chain polymerizes, HS/Hep undergoes a series of modification reactions including N-deacetylation, N-sulfation, epimerization, and subsequently O-sulfation. As final products of biosynthesis, HS is present in the form of hepran sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) whereas Hep exists as a sugar chain without a core protein. The proteoglycan families with HS, as well as CS (chondroitin sulfate), DS (dermatan sulfate), and KS (keratan sulfate), are composed of two main types depending on the subcellular locations: cell membrane and extracellular matrix [BR:ko00535].

Pimeloyl-ACP is converted to biotin through the final four steps in the biotin bicyclic ring assembly, which are conserved among biotin-producing organisms [MD:M00123]. In B. subtilis, biotin is derived from pimeloyl-ACP formed by oxidative cleavage of long-chain acyl-ACPs [MD:M00573]. Some bacteria synthesize biotin from pimeloyl-CoA derived from pimelate [MD:M00577]. Biotin is covalently attached to biotin-dependent carboxylase by biotin protein ligase, also known as holocarboxylase synthase in mammals, to form an active holocarboxylase. After degradation of the biotinylated carboxylase into biocytin, it is further degraded by biotinidase to release free biotin, which is recycled in holocarboxylase synthesis. Biotin is catabolized by beta-oxidation of the valeric acid side chain or oxidation of sulfur in the heterocyclic ring.",NA,

NETs are formed by a process known as ""NETosis"" that can be triggered by microorganisms and endogenous stimuli, such as damage-associated molecular patterns and immune complexes, and involves activation in most cases of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent study has reported that there are two different mechanisms of NETosis, including a lytic NETosis and a vital NETosis. Lytic NETosis begins with nuclear delobulation and the disassembly of the nuclear envelope and continues with loss of cellular polarization, chromatin decondensation and plasma membrane rupture. Vital NETosis can occur independently of cell death and involves the secreted expulsion of nuclear chromatin that is accompanied by the release of granule proteins through degranulation.",NA,

Sulfur occurs in various oxidation states ranging from +6 in sulfate to -2 in sulfide (H2S). Sulfate reduction can occur in both an energy consuming assimilatory pathway and an energy producing dissimilatory pathway. The assimilatory pathway, which is found in a wide range of organisms, produces reduced sulfur compounds for the biosynthesis of S-containing amino acids and does not lead to direct excretion of sulfide. In the dissimilatory pathway, which is restricted to obligatory anaerobic bacterial and archaeal lineages, sulfate (or sulfur) is the terminal electron acceptor of the respiratory chain producing large quantities of inorganic sulfide. Both pathways start from the activation of sulfate by reaction with ATP to form adenylyl sulfate (APS). In the assimilatory pathway [MD:M00176] APS is converted to 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) and then reduced to sulfite, and sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the assimilatory sulfite reductase. In the dissimilatory pathway [MD:M00596] APS is directly reduced to sulfite, and sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase. The capacity for oxidation of sulfur is quite widespread among bacteria and archaea, comprising phototrophs and chemolithoautotrophs. The SOX (sulfur-oxidation) system [MD:M00595] is a well-known sulfur oxidation pathway and is found in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis with reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide and elemental sulfur, as well as thiosulfate (in some species with the SOX system), as the electron donor for photoautotrophic growth. In some chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers (such as Thiobacillus denitrificans), it has been suggested that dissimilatory sulfur reduction enzymes operate in the reverse direction, forming a sulfur oxidation pathway from sulfite to APS and then to sulfate.",NA,

Entry of Ca2+ is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2+ by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2+ fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2+-entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs).
The other principal source of Ca2+ for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2+. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2+ itself and this process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release is central to the mechanism of Ca2+ signalling. Various second messengers or modulators also control the release of Ca2+. IP3, which is generated by pathways using different isoforms of phospholipase C (PLCbeta, delta, epsilon, gamma and zeta), regulates the IP3Rs. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) releases Ca2+ via RYRs. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) may activate a distinct Ca2+ release mechanism on separate acidic Ca2+ stores. Ca2+ release via the NAADP-sensitive mechanism may also feedback onto either RYRs or IP3Rs. cADPR and NAADP are generated by CD38. This enzyme might be sensitive to the cellular metabolism, as ATP and NADH inhibit it.
The influx of Ca2+ from the environment or release from internal stores causes a very rapid and dramatic increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which has been widely exploited for signal transduction. Some proteins, such as troponin C (TnC) involved in muscle contraction, directly bind to and sense Ca2+. However, in other cases Ca2+ is sensed through intermediate calcium sensors such as calmodulin (CALM).",NA,

At meiosis I, homologous chromosomes recombine and then segregate to opposite poles, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In vertebrates, immature oocytes are arrested at the PI (prophase of meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is stimulated by progesterone, which carries the oocyte through two consecutive M-phases (MI and MII) to a second arrest at MII. The key activity driving meiotic progression is the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a heterodimer of CDC2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) and cyclin B. In PI-arrested oocytes, MPF is initially inactive and is activated by the dual-specificity CDC25C phosphatase as the result of new synthesis of Mos induced by progesterone. MPF activation mediates the transition from the PI arrest to MI. The subsequent decrease in MPF levels, required to exit from MI into interkinesis, is induced by a negative feedback loop, where CDC2 brings about the activation of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex), which mediates destruction of cyclin B. Re-activation of MPF for MII requires re-accumulation of high levels of cyclin B as well as the inactivation of the APC by newly synthesized Emi2 and other components of the CSF (cytostatic factor), such as cyclin E or high levels of Mos. CSF antagonizes the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC, preventing cyclin B destruction and meiotic exit until fertilization occurs.

The onset of apoptosis is controlled by numerous interrelating processes.

The 'intrinsic' pathway is activated mainly by non-receptor stimuli, such as DNA damage, ER stress, metabolic stress, UV radiation or growth-factor deprivation. The central event in the 'intrinsic' pathway is the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which leads to the release of cytochrome c. These two pathways converge at the level of effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. The third major pathway is initiated by the constituents of cytotoxic granules (e.g. Perforin and Granzyme B) that are released by CTLs (cytotoxic T-cells) and NK (natural killer) cells. Granzyme B, similarly to the caspases, cleaves its substrates after aspartic acid residues, suggesting that this protease has the ability to activate members of the caspase family directly.

On contraction, VSMCs shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure.The principal mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of VSMCs are changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). In response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, Ca2+ is mobilized from intracellular stores and/or the extracellular space to increase [Ca2+]c in VSMCs.

Upon arrival of an action potential, Ca2+ enters through voltage-gated channels and neurotransmitter is released by exocytosis, usually in less than a millisecond. After fusion, the vesicle is retrieved by endocytosis and reloaded for another round of exocytosis.",NA,

In the ER, the A-chain (CTXA) is recognized by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), unfolded, and delivered to the membrane where the membrane-associated ER-oxidase, Ero1, oxidizes PDI to release the CTXA into the protein-conducting channel, Sec61. CTXA is then retro-translocated to the cytosol and induces water and electrolyte secretion by increasing cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase (AC) to exert toxicity.Other than CTX, Vibrio cholerae generates several toxins that are perilous to eukaryotic cells. Zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) causes tight junction disruption through protein kinase C-dependent actin polymerization. RTX toxin (RtxA) causes actin depolymerization by covalently cross-linking actin monomers into dimers, trimers, and higher multimers.

VacA binds to lipid rafts and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) of the target cell membrane. After insertion into the plasma membrane, VacA channels are endocytosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartments, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancement of the electrogenic vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump. In the presence of weak bases, osmotically active acidotropic ions will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, an essential step in vacuole formation. In addition, it is reported that the VacA cleavage product binds to the tyrosine phosphatase receptor zeta (Ptprz) on epithelial cells and the induced signaling leads to the phosphorylation of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1 (Git1) and induces ulcerogenesis in mice.
The other virulence factor cag T4SS mediates the translocation of the effector protein CagA, which is subsequently phosphorylated by a Src kinase. Phosphorylated CagA interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, thus stimulating its phosphatase activity. Activated SHP-2 is able to induce MAPK signalling through Ras/Raf-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Deregulation of this pathway by CagA may lead to abnormal proliferation and movement of gastric epithelial cells.",NA,

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis.

Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies.

The two principal pathways of apoptosis are (1) the Bcl-2 inhibitable or intrinsic pathway induced by various forms of stress like intracellular damage, developmental cues, and external stimuli and (2) the caspase 8/10 dependent or extrinsic pathway initiated by the engagement of death receptors The caspase 8/10 dependent or extrinsic pathway is a death receptor mediated mechanism that results in the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10.

The rupture of the mitochondrial membrane, a rapid process involving some of the Bcl-2 family proteins, releases these molecules into the cytoplasm. Examples of cellular processes that may induce the intrinsic pathway in response to various damage signals include: auto reactivity in lymphocytes, cytokine deprivation, calcium flux or cellular damage by cytotoxic drugs like taxol, deprivation of nutrients like glucose and growth factors like EGF, anoikis, transactivation of target genes by tumor suppressors including p53.

Under these circumstances, a short stretch of residues containing the abasic site is excised and replaced (Dianov et al., 1999). Following DNA glycosylase-mediated cleavage of the damaged base, the endonuclease APEX1 is recruited to the site of damage where it cleaves the 5' side of the abasic deoxyribose residue, as in the single nucleotide replacement pathway. However, POLB then synthesizes the first replacement residue without prior cleavage of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate, hence displacing this entity.

The synapse involves a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron, muscle cell or glad cell. The pre and the postsynaptic cell are separated by a gap (space) of 20 to 40 nm called the synaptic cleft. The signals pass in a single direction from the presynaptic to postsynaptic neuron (cell). The presynaptic neuron communicates via the release of neurotransmitter which bind the receptors on the postsynaptic cell. The process is initiated when an action potential invades the terminal membrane of the presynaptic neuron. Action potentials occur in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscles and endocrine cells. They are initiated by the transient opening of voltage dependent sodium channels, causing a rapid, large depolarization of membrane potentials that spread along the axon membrane. When action potentials arrive at the synaptic terminals, depolarization in membrane potential leads to the opening of voltage gated calcium channels located on the presynaptic membrane. The external Ca2+ concentration is approximately 10-3 M while the internal Ca2+ concentration is approximately 10-7 M. Opening of calcium channels causes a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal. The elevated presynaptic Ca2+ concentration allows synaptic vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane of the presynaptic neuron and release their contents, neurotransmitters, into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic cells. Activation of postsynaptic receptors upon neurotransmitter binding can lead to a multitude of effects in the postsynaptic cell, such as changing the membrane potential and excitability, and triggering intracellular signaling cascades",NA,

In particular, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3(ERK1) and MAPK1 (ERK2) are involved in diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, regulation of inflammatory responses, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell motility and invasion through the increase of matrix metalloproteinase production (Viala E & Pouyssegur J 2004; Hsu MC et al. 2006; Dawson CW et al.2008; Kuriakose T et al. 2014).The canonical RAF:MAP2K:MAPK1/3 cascade is stimulated by various extracellular stimuli including hormones, cytokines, growth factors, heat shock and UV irradiation triggering the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and leading to?the activation of the RAF MAP3 kinases. However, many physiological and pathological stimuli have been found to activate MAPK1/3 independently of RAF and RAS (Dawson CW et al. 2008; Wang J et al. 2009; Kuriakose T et al. 2014). For example, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not RAF1, was reported to regulate MAP2K1/2 and MAPK1/3 (MEK and ERK) activation in rat hepatoma H4IIE and human erythroleukemia K562 cells in response to autophagy stimuli (Wang J et al. 2009). Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2, also known as MAP3K8 and COT) is another MAP3 kinase which promotes MAPK1/3 (ERK)-regulated immune responses downstream of toll-like receptors (TLR), TNF receptor and IL1beta signaling pathways (Gantke T et al. 2011).In response to stimuli the cell surface receptors transmit signals inducing MAP3 kinases, e.g., TPL2, MEKK1, which in turn phosphorylate MAP2Ks (MEK1/2). MAP2K then phosphorylate and activate the MAPK1/3 (ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs). Activated MAPK1/3 phosphorylate and regulate the activities of an ever growing pool of substrates that are estimated to comprise over 160 proteins (Yoon and Seger 2006). The majority of ERK substrates are nuclear proteins, but others are found in the cytoplasm and other organelles. Activated MAPK1/3 can translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and regulate various transcription factors, such as Ets family transcription factors (e.g., ELK1), ultimately leading to changes in gene expression (Zuber J et al. 2000).",NA,

It was originally identified by its ability to stimulate the development of the mammary gland and lactation, but is now known to have numerous and varied functions (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998). Despite this, few pathologies have been associated with abnormalities in prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling, though roles in various forms of cancer and certain autoimmune disorders have been suggested (Goffin et al. 2002). A vast body of literature suggests effects of PRL in immune cells (Matera 1996) but PRLR KO mice have unaltered immune system development and function (Bouchard et al. 1999). In addition to the pituitary, numerous other tissues produce PRL, including the decidua and myometrium, certain cells of the immune system, brain, skin and exocrine glands such as the mammary, sweat and lacrimal glands (Ben-Jonathan et al. 1996). Pituitary PRL secretion is negatively regulated by inhibitory factors originating from?the hypothalamus, the most important of which is dopamine, acting through the D2 subclass of dopamine receptors present in lactotrophs (Freeman et al. 2000). PRL-binding sites or receptors have been identified in numerous cells and tissues of adult mammals. Various forms of PRLR, generated by alternative splicing, have been reported in several species including humans (Kelly et al. 1991, Clevenger et al. 2003).PRLR is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Like many other members of this family, the first step in receptor activation was generally believed to be ligand-induced dimerization whereby one molecule of PRL bound to two molecules of receptor (Elkins et al. 2000). Recent reports suggest that PRLR pre-assembles at the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand (Gadd & Clevenger 2006, Tallet et al. 2011), suggesting that ligand-induced activation involves conformational changes in preformed PRLR dimers (Broutin et al. 2010). PRLR has no intrinsic kinase activity but associates (Lebrun et al. 1994, 1995) with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) which is activated following receptor activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994, Carter-Su et al. 2000, Barua et al. 2009). JAK2-dependent activation of JAK1 has also been reported (Neilson et al. 2007). It is generally accepted that activation of JAK2 occurs by transphosphorylation upon ligand-induced receptor activation, based on JAK activation by chimeric receptors in which various extracellular domains of cytokine or tyrosine kinase receptors were fused to the IL-2 receptor beta chain (see Ihle et al. 1994). This activation step involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates PRLR on specific intracellular tyrosine residues leading to STAT5 recruitment and signaling, considered to be the most important signaling cascade for PRLR. STAT1 and STAT3 activation have also been reported (DaSilva et al. 1996) as have many other signaling pathways; signaling through MAP kinases (Shc/SOS/Grb2/Ras/Raf/MAPK) has been reported as a consequence of PRL stimuilation in many different cellular systems (see Bole-Feysot et al. 1998) though it is not clear how this signal is propagated. Other cascades non exhaustively include Src kinases, Focal adhesion kinase, phospholipase C gamma, PI3 kinase/Akt and Nek3 (Clevenger et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2007). The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is recruited to the C terminal tyrosine of PRLR and may have a regulatory role (Ali & Ali 2000). PRLR phosphotyrosines can recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and other adaptor proteins to the receptor complex (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998).Female homozygous PRLR knockout mice are completely infertile and show a lack of mammary development (Ormandy et al. 1997).

NODAL also forms heterodimers with GDF1, which increases NODAL activity. NODAL dimers bind the NODAL receptor comprising a type I Activin receptor (ACVR1B or ACVR1C), a type II Activin receptor (ACVR2A or ACVR2B), and an EGF-CFC coreceptor (CRIPTO or CRYPTIC). After binding NODAL, the type II activin receptor phosphorylates the type I activin receptor which then phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3 (R-SMADs).

Dendritic cells are also present, serving as important players in antigen presentation for ensuing adaptive responses (Savina A & Amigorena S 2007). These cell types are able to bind and engulf invading microbes into a membrane-enclosed vacuole - the phagosome, in a process termed phagocytosis. Phagocytosis can be defined as the receptor-mediated engulfment of particles greater than 0.5 micron in diameter. It is initiated by the cross-linking of host cell membrane receptors following engagement with their cognate ligands on the target surface (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al.?2012). When engulfed by phagocytes, microorganisms are exposed to a number of host defense microbicidal events within the resulting phagosome. These include the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, RONS) by specialized enzymes (Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013). NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex consume oxygen to produce superoxide radical anion (O2.-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Robinson et al. 2004). Induced NO synthase (iNOS) is involved in the production of NO, which is the primary source of all RNS in biological systems (Evans TG et al. 1996). The phagocyte NADPH oxidase and iNOS are expressed in both PMN and mononuclear phagocytes and both cell types have the capacity for phagosomal burst activity. However, the magnitude of ROS generation in neutrophils far exceeds that observed in macrophages (VanderVen BC et al. 2009). Macrophages are thought to produce considerably more RNS than neutrophils (Fang FC et al. 2004; Nathan & Shiloh 2000).The presence of RONS characterized by a relatively low reactivity, such as H2O2, O2¨B? or NO, has no deleterious effect on biological environment (Attia SM 2010; Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015). Their activity is controlled by endogenous antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) that are induced by oxidative stress. However the relatively low reactive species can initiate a cascade of reactions to generate more damaging ¡°secondary¡± species such as hydroxyl radical (?OH), singlet oxygen or peroxinitrite (Robinson JM 2008; Fang FC et al. 2004). These ""secondary"" RONS are extremely toxic causing irreversible damage to all classes of biomolecules (Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015; Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013).Although macrophages and neutrophils use similar mechanisms for the internalization of targets, there are differences in how they perform phagocytosis and in the final outcome of the process (Tapper H & Grinstein S 1997; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Once formed, the phagosome undergoes an extensive maturation process whereby it develops into a microbicidal organelle able to eliminate the invading pathogen. Maturation involves re-modeling both the membrane of the phagosome and its luminal contents (Vierira OV et al. 2002). In macrophages, phagosome formation and maturation follows a series of strictly coordinated membrane fission/fusion events between the phagosome and compartments of the endo/lysosomal network gradually transforming the nascent phagosome into a phagolysosome, a degradative organelle endowed with potent microbicidal properties (Zimmerli S et al. 1996; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Neutrophils instead contain a large number of preformed granules such as azurophilic and specific granules that can rapidly fuse with phagosomes delivering antimicrobial substances (Karlsson A & Dahlgren C 2002; Naucler C et al. 2002; Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011). Phagosomal pH dynamics may also contribute to the maturation process by regulating membrane traffic events. The microbicidal activity of macrophages is characterized by progressive acidification of the lumen (down to pH 4¨C5) by the proton pumping vATPase. A low pH is a prerequisite for optimal enzymatic activity of most late endosomal/lysosomal hydrolases reported in macrophages. Neutrophil phagosome pH regulation differs significantly from what is observed in macrophages (Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011; Winterbourn CC et al. 2016). The massive activation of the oxidative burst is thought to result in early alkalization of neutrophil phagosomes which is linked to proton consumption during the generation of hydrogen peroxide (Segal AW et al. 1981; Levine AP et al. 2015). Other studies showed that neutrophil phagosome maintained neutral pH values before the pH gradually decreased (Jankowski A et al. 2002). Neutrophil phagosomes also exhibited a high proton leak, which was initiated upon activation of the NADPH oxidase, and this activation counteracted phagosomal acidification (Jankowski A et al. 2002).The Reactome module describes ROS and RNS production by phagocytic cells. The module includes cell-type specific events, for example, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated production of hypochlorous acid in neutrophils. It also highlights differences between phagosomal pH dynamics in neutrophils and macrophages. The module describes microbicidal activity of selective RONS such as hydroxyl radical or peroxynitrite. However, detection of any of these species in the phagosomal environment is subject to many uncertainties (N¨¹sse O 2011; Erard M et al. 2018). The mechanisms by which reactive oxygen/nitrogen species kill pathogens in phagocytic immune cells are still not fully understood.",NA,

These include dwarfism syndromes (achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and the neonatal lethal disorders thanatophoric dysplasia I and II), as well as craniosynostosis disorders such as Pfeiffer, Apert, Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss and Muenke syndromes (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue 1997; Burke, 1998, Cunningham, 2007; Harada, 2009). These mutations fall into four general regions of the receptor: a) the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain II-III linker region, b) the alternatively spliced second half of the Ig III domain, c) the transmembrane domain and d) the tyrosine kinase domain (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997). With the exception of mutations in class b), which affect only the relevant splice variant, these mutations may be present in either the 'b' or 'c' isoforms. These activating mutations affect FGFR function by altering or expanding the ligand-binding?range of the receptors (see for instance Ibrahimi, 2004a), by promoting ligand-independent dimerization (for instance, Galvin,1996; Neilson and Friesel, 1996; d'Avis,1998) or by increasing the activity of the kinase domain (for instance, Webster, 1996; Naski, 1996; Tavormina, 1999; Bellus, 2000). Thus, a number of the point mutations found in FGFR receptors alter their activity without altering their intrinsic kinase activity. Many of the mutations that promote constitutive dimerization do so by creating or removing cysteine residues; the presence of an unpaired cysteine in the receptor is believed to promote dimerization through the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds (Galvin, 1996; Robertson, 1998). Paralogous mutations at equivalent positions have been identified in more than one FGF receptor, sometimes giving rise to different diseases. For instance, mutation of the highly conserved FGFR2 Ser252-Pro253 dipeptide in the region between the second and third Ig domain is responsible for virtually all cases of Apert Syndrome (Wilkie, 1995), while paralogous mutations in FGFR1 (S252R) and FGFR3 (P250R) are associated with Pfeiffer and Crouzon syndromes, respectively (Bellus, 1996). FGFR4 is unique in that mutations of this gene are not known to be associated with any developmental disorders.Recently, many of the same activating mutations in the FGFR genes that have been characterized in skeletal and developmental disorders have begun to be identified in a range of cancers (reviewed in Turner and Gross, 2010; Greulich and Pollock, 2011; Wesche, 2011). The best established link between a somatic mutation of an FGFR and the development of cancer is in the case of FGFR3, where 50% of bladder cancers have mutations in the FGFR3 coding sequence. Of these mutations, which largely match the activating mutations seen in thanatophoric dysplasias, over half occur at a single residue (S249C) (Cappellen, 1999; van Rhijn, 2002). Activating mutations have also been identified in the coding sequences of FGFR1, 2 and 4 (for review, see Wesche, 2011)In addition to activating point mutations, the FGFR1, 2 and 3 genes are subject to misregulation in cancer through gene amplification and translocation events, which are thought to lead to overexpression and ligand-independent dimerization (Weiss, 2010; Turner, 2010; Kunii, 2008; Takeda, 2007; Chesi, 1997; Avet-Loiseau, 1998; Ronchetti, 2001). It is important to note, however, that in each of these cases, the amplification or translocation involve large genomic regions encompassing additional genes, and the definitive roles of the FGFR genes in promoting oncogenesis has not been totally established. In the case of FGFR1, translocation events also give rise to FGFR1 fusion proteins that contain the intracellular kinase domain of the receptor fused to a dimerization domain from the partner gene. These fusions, which are expressed in a pre-leukemic myeloproliferative syndrome, dimerize constitutively based on the dimerization domain provided by the fusion partner and are constitutively active (reviewed in Jackson, 2010).",NA,

ERBB2 possesses an extracellular domain that does not bind any known ligand, contrary to other EGFR family members, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain consisting of an active kinase and a C-tail with multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Inactive ERBB2 is associated with a chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and its co-chaperone CDC37 (Xu et al. 2001, Citri et al. 2004, Xu et al. 2005). In addition, ERBB2 is associated with ERBB2IP (also known as ERBIN or LAP2), a protein responsible for proper localization of ERBB2. In epithelial cells, ERBB2IP restricts expression of ERBB2 to basolateral plasma membrane regions (Borg et al. 2000). ERBB2 becomes activated by forming a heterodimer with another ligand-activated EGFR family member, either EGFR, ERBB3 or ERBB4, which is accompanied by dissociation of chaperoning proteins HSP90 and CDC37 (Citri et al. 2004), as well as ERBB2IP (Borg et al. 2000) from ERBB2. ERBB2 heterodimers function to promote cell proliferation, cell survival and differentiation, depending on the cellular context. ERBB2 can also be activated by homodimerization when it is overexpressed, in cancer for example. In cells expressing both ERBB2 and EGFR, EGF stimulation of EGFR leads to formation of both ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers (Wada et al. 1990, Karunagaran et al. 1996) and EGFR homodimers. Heterodimers of ERBB2 and EGFR trans-autophosphorylate on twelve tyrosine residues, six in the C-tail of EGFR and six in the C-tail of ERBB2 - Y1023, Y1139, Y1196, Y1221, Y1222 and Y1248 (Margolis et al. 1989, Hazan et al. 1990,Walton et al. 1990, Helin et al. 1991, Ricci et al. 1995, Pinkas-Kramarski 1996). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the C-tail of EGFR and ERBB2 serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Three key signaling pathways activated by ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers are RAF/MAP kinase cascade, PI3K-induced AKT signaling, and signaling by phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1). Downregulation of EGFR signaling is mediated by ubiquitin ligase CBL, and is shown under Signaling by EGFR. In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3, ERBB3 activated by neuregulin NRG1 or NRG2 binding (Tzahar et al. 1994) forms a heterodimer with ERBB2 (Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Citri et al. 2004). ERBB3 is the only EGFR family member with no kinase activity, and can only function in heterodimers, with ERBB2 being its preferred heterodimerization partner. After heterodimerization, ERBB2 phosphorylates ten tyrosine residues in the C-tail of ERBB3, Y1054, Y1197, Y1199, Y1222, Y1224, Y1260, Y1262, Y1276, Y1289 and Y1328 (Prigent et al. 1994, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Vijapurkar et al. 2003, Li et al. 2007) that subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, resulting in activation of PI3K-induced AKT signaling and RAF/MAP kinase cascade. Signaling by ERBB3 is downregulated by the action of RNF41 ubiquitin ligase, also known as NRDP1. In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB4, ligand stimulated ERBB4 can either homodimerize or form heterodimers with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007), resulting in trans-autophosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB4 on C-tail tyrosine residues that will subsequently serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, leading to activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade and, in the case of ERBB4 CYT1 isoforms, PI3K-induced AKT signaling (Hazan et al. 1990, Cohen et al. 1996, Li et al. 2007, Kaushansky et al. 2008).

In addition to HER2 gene amplification, sequencing of tumour samples have revealed HER2 mutations, which fall within three major regions: the extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain/ juxtamembrane domain (TMD/JMD) and kinase domain (KD). Based on the functional studies of their catalytic activity, signaling and drug sensitivity, as well as their time of occurence with respect to treatment, these mutation can be classified as primary mutations, that can be activating or silent, and may confer drug resistance, and secondary mutations, associated with development of drug resistance upon initial response to targeted therapy.Overexpression of ERBB2 (HER2) protein, usually as a consequence of ERBB2 gene amplification, leads to formation of constitutively active, growth factor independent, ERBB2 homodimers, which are sensitive to the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) (Pickl and?Ries 2009).Co-overexpression of ERBB2 and its dimerization partner ERBB3 leads to formation of both ERBB2 homodimers and ERRB2:ERBB3 heterodimers and is associated with chemotherapy resistance and reduced relapse-free and overall survival (Spears et al. 2012).Mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of ERBB2 result in constitutive activation of ERBB2 signaling, facilitate heterodimerization of ERBB2 with other EGFR family members and increase the signaling intensity (Kancha et al. 2011). Functionally studied ERBB2 KD mutants include ERBB2 L755S, ERBB2 L755P, ERBB2 I767M, ERBB2 D769H, ERBB2 V777L, ERBB2 P780_Y781insGSP, ERBB2 T798I, ERBB2 T798M, ERBB2 V842I, ERBB2 T862A, ERBB2 L869R, ERBB2 H878Y and ERBB2 R896C (Kancha et al. 2011, Bose et al. 2013, Collier et al. 2013, Hu, Wan et al. 2015; Hu, Hu et al. 2015, Hanker et al. 2017, Croessmann et al. 2019).Sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) differs between different ERBB2 KD mutants (Bose et al. 2013, Rexer et al. 2013, Nagano et al. 2018).ERBB2 extracellular domain (ECD) mutants harbor missense mutations that lead to substitutions of amino acid residues in the heterodimerization arm contact surface, involved in formation of ERBB2 heterodimers (Greulich et al. 2012).Recurrent missense mutations in regions encoding the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) are frequently reported in cancer. TMD and JMD mutations can activate ERBB2 signaling by improving the active dimer interface or by stabilizing the active conformation (Ou et al. 2017, Pahuja et al. 2018).ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants differ in their sensitivity to the therapeutic antibody pertuzumab, which blocks ligand-driven heterodimerization of ERBB2 (Pahuja et al. 2018).",NA,

Here we have annotated one aspect of cellular responses to oxygen, the role of hypoxia-inducible factor in regulating cellular transcriptional responses to changes in oxygen availability.In the presence of oxygen members of the transcription factor family HIF-alpha, comprising HIF1A, HIF2A (EPAS1), and HIF3A, are hydroxylated on proline residues by PHD1 (EGLN2), PHD2 (EGLN1), and PHD3 (EGLN3) and on asparagine residues by HIF1AN (FIH) (reviewed in Pouyssegur et al. 2006, Semenza 2007, Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008, Nizet and Johnson 2009, Brahimi-Horn and Pouyssegur 2009, Majmundar et al. 2010, Loenarz and Schofield 2011).

Epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain mutants are present in ~16% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), but are also found in other cancer types, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer. EGFR kinase domain mutants harbor activating mutations in exons 18-21 which code for the kinase domain (amino acids 712-979) . Small deletions, insertions or substitutions of amino acids within the kinase domain lock EGFR in its active conformation in which the enzyme can dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation spontaneously, without ligand binding (although ligand binding ability is preserved), and activate downstream signaling pathways that promote cell survival (Greulich et al. 2005, Zhang et al. 2006, Yun et al. 2007, Red Brewer et al. 2009). Point mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR are frequently found in glioblastoma. Similar to kinase domain mutations, point mutations in the extracellular domain result in constitutively active EGFR proteins that signal in the absence of ligands, but ligand binding ability and responsiveness are preserved (Lee et al. 2006). EGFR kinase domain mutants need to maintain association with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) for proper functioning (Shimamura et al. 2005, Lavictoire et al. 2003). CDC37 is a co-chaperone of HSP90 that acts as a scaffold and regulator of interaction between HSP90 and its protein kinase clients. CDC37 is frequently over-expressed in cancers involving mutant kinases and acts as an oncogene (Roe et al. 2004, reviewed by Gray Jr. et al. 2008). Over-expression of the wild-type EGFR or EGFR cancer mutants results in aberrant activation of downstream signaling cascades, namely RAS/RAF/MAP kinase signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling, and possibly signaling by PLCG1, which leads to increased cell proliferation and survival, providing selective advantage to cancer cells that harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene (Sordella et al. 2004, Huang et al. 2007). While growth factor activated wild-type EGFR is promptly down-regulated by internalization and degradation, cancer mutants of EGFR demonstrate prolonged activation (Lynch et al. 2004). Association of HSP90 with EGFR kinase domain mutants negatively affects CBL-mediated ubiquitination, possibly through decreasing the affinity of EGFR kinase domain mutants for phosphorylated CBL, so that CBL dissociates from the complex upon phosphorylation and cannot perform ubiquitination (Yang et al. 2006, Padron et al. 2007). Various molecular therapeutics are being developed to target aberrantly activated EGFR in cancer. Non-covalent (reversible) small tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, selectively bind kinase domain of EGFR, competitively inhibiting ATP binding and subsequent autophosphorylation of EGFR dimers. EGFR kinase domain mutants sensitive to non-covalent TKIs exhibit greater affinity for TKIs than ATP compared with the wild-type EGFR protein, and are therefore preferential targets of non-covalent TKI therapeutics (Yun et al. 2007). EGFR proteins that harbor point mutations in the extracellular domain also show sensitivity to non-covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Lee et al. 2006). EGFR kinase domain mutants harboring small insertions in exon 20 or a secondary T790M mutation are resistant to reversible TKIs (Balak et al. 2006) due to increased affinity for ATP (Yun et al. 2008), and are targets of covalent (irreversible) TKIs that form a covalent bond with EGFR cysteine residue C397. However, effective concentrations of covalent TKIs also inhibit wild-type EGFR, causing severe side effects (Zhou et al. 2009). Hence, covalent TKIs have not shown much promise in clinical trials (Reviewed by Pao and Chmielecki in 2010).",NA,

Similar to EGFR, ERBB4 has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain which contains an active tyrosine kinase and a C-tail with multiple phosphorylation sites. At least three and possibly four splicing isoforms of ERBB4 exist that differ in their C-tail and/or the extracellular juxtamembrane regions: ERBB4 JM-A CYT1, ERBB4 JM-A CYT2 and ERBB4 JM-B CYT1 (the existence of ERBB4 JM-B CYT2 has not been confirmed). ERBB4 becomes activated by binding one of its seven ligands, three of which, HB-EGF, epiregulin EPR and betacellulin BTC, are EGF-like (Elenius et al. 1997, Riese et al. 1998), while four, NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4, belong to the related neuregulin family (Tzahar et al. 1994, Carraway et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997, Hayes et al. 2007). Upon ligand binding, ERBB4 forms homodimers (Sweeney etÂ al. 2000) or it heterodimerizes with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007). Dimers of ERBB4 undergo trans-autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the C-tail (Cohen et al. 1996, Kaushansky et al. 2008, Hazan et al. 1990, Li et al. 2007), triggering downstream signaling cascades. The pathway Signaling by ERBB4 only shows signaling by ERBB4 homodimers. Signaling by heterodimers of ERBB4 and ERBB2 is shown in the pathway Signaling by ERBB2. Ligand-stimulated ERBB4 is also able to form heterodimers with ligand-stimulated EGFR (Cohen et al. 1996) and ligand-stimulated ERBB3 (Riese et al. 1995). Dimers of ERBB4 with EGFR and dimers of ERBB4 with ERBB3 were demonstrated in mouse cell lines in which human ERBB4 and EGFR or ERBB3 were exogenously expressed. These heterodimers undergo trans-autophosphorylation. The promiscuous heteromerization of ERBBs adds combinatorial diversity to ERBB signaling processes. As ERBB4 binds more ligands than other ERBBs, but has restricted expression, ERBB4 expression channels responses to ERBB ligands. The signaling capabilities of the four receptors have been compared (Schulze et al. 2005).As for other receptor tyrosine kinases, ERBB4 signaling effectors are largely dictated through binding of effector proteins to ERBB4 peptides that are phosphorylated upon ligand binding. All splicing isoforms of ERBB4 possess two tyrosine residues in the C-tail that serve as docking sites for SHC1 (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996, Cohen et al. 1996). Once bound to ERBB4, SHC1 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the tyrosine kinase activity of ERBB4, which enables it to recruit the complex of GRB2 and SOS1, resulting in the guanyl-nucleotide exchange on RAS and activation of RAF and MAP kinase cascade (Kainulainen et al. 2000). The CYT1 isoforms of ERBB4 also possess a C-tail tyrosine residue that, upon trans-autophosphorylation, serves as a docking site for the p85 alpha subunit of PI3K (Kaushansky et al. 2008, Cohen et al. 1996), leading to assembly of an active PI3K complex that converts PIP2 to PIP3 and activates AKT signaling (Kainulainen et al. 2000). Besides signaling as a conventional transmembrane receptor kinase, ERBB4 differs from other ERBBs in that JM-A isoforms signal through efficient release of a soluble intracellular domain. Ligand activated homodimers of ERBB4 JM-A isoforms (ERBB4 JM-A CYT1 and ERBB4 JM-A CYT2) undergo proteolytic cleavage by ADAM17 (TACE) in the juxtamembrane region, resulting in shedding of the extracellular domain and formation of an 80 kDa membrane bound ERBB4 fragment known as ERBB4 m80 (Rio et al. 2000, Cheng et al. 2003). ERBB4 m80 undergoes further proteolytic cleavage, mediated by the gamma-secretase complex, which releases the soluble 80 kDa ERBB4 intracellular domain, known as ERBB4 s80 or E4ICD, into the cytosol (Ni et al. 2001). ERBB4 s80 is able to translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear translocation of various transcription factors, and act as a transcription co-factor. For example, in mammary cells, ERBB4 binds SH2 transcription factor STAT5A. ERBB4 s80 shuttles STAT5A to the nucleus, and actsa as a STAT5A co-factor in binding to and promoting transcription from the beta-casein (CSN2) promoter, and may be involved in the regulation of other lactation-related genes (Jones et al. 1999, Williams et al. 2004, Muraoka-Cook et al. 2008). ERBB4 s80 binds activated estrogen receptor in the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional co-factor in promoting transcription of some estrogen-regulated genes, including progesterone receptor gene NR3C3 and CXCL12 (SDF1) (Zhu et al. 2006). In neuronal precursors, ERBB4 s80 binds the complex of TAB and NCOR1, helps to move the complex into the nucleus, and is a co-factor of TAB:NCOR1-mediated inhibition of expression of astrocyte differentiation genes GFAP and S100B (Sardi et al. 2006).The C-tail of ERBB4 possesses several WW-domain binding motifs (three in CYT1 isoform and two in CYT2 isoform), which enable interaction of ERBB4 with WW-domain containing proteins. ERBB4 s80, through WW-domain binding motifs, interacts with YAP1 transcription factor, a known proto-oncogene, and is a co-regulator of YAP1-mediated transcription in association with TEAD transcription factors (Komuro et al. 2003, Omerovic et al. 2004). Hence, the WW binding motif couples ERBB4 to the major effector arm of the HIPPO signaling pathway. The tumor suppressor WWOX, another WW-domain containing protein, competes with YAP1 in binding to ERBB4 s80 and prevents translocation of ERBB4 s80 to the nucleus (Aqeilan et al. 2005).WW-domain binding motifs in the C-tail of ERBB4 play an important role in the downregulation of ERBB4 receptor signaling, enabling the interaction of intact ERBB4, ERBB4 m80 and ERBB4 s80 with NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases WWP1 and ITCH. The interaction of WWP1 and ITCH with intact ERBB4 is independent of receptor activation and autophosphorylation. Binding of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of ERBB4 and its cleavage products, and subsequent degradation through both proteasomal and lysosomal routes (Omerovic et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2009). In addition, the s80 cleavage product of ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform is the target of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. NEDD4 binds ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 s80 (ERBB4jmAcyt1s80) through its PIK3R1 interaction site and mediates ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 ubiquitination, thereby decreasing the amount of ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 that reaches the nucleus (Zeng et al. 2009).ERBB4 also binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and inhibitor of p53 (Arasada et al. 2005). Other proteins that bind to ERBB4 intracellular domain have been identified by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Gilmore-Hebert et al., 2010), and include transcriptional co-repressor TRIM28/KAP1, which promotes chromatin compaction. DNA damage signaling through ATM releases TRIM28-associated heterochromatinization. Interactions of ERBB4 with TRIM28 and MDM2 may be important for integration of growth factor responses and DNA damage responses.In human breast cancer cell lines, ERBB4 activation enhances anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar but inhibits cell growth in a monolayer culture. Different ERBB4 ligands induce different gene expression changes in breast cancer cell lines. Some of the genes induced in response to ERBB4 signaling in breast cancer cell lines are RAB2, EPS15R and GATA4. It is not known if these gene are direct transcriptional targets of ERBB4 (Amin et al. 2004).Transcriptome and ChIP-seq comparisons of full-length and intracellular domain isoforms in isogenic MCF10A mammary cell background have revealed the diversification of ERBB4 signaling engendered by alternative splicing and cleavage (Wali et al., 2014). ERBB4 broadly affected protease expression, cholesterol biosynthesis, HIF1-alpha signaling, and HIPPO signaling pathways, and other pathways were differentially activated by CYT1 and CYT2 isoforms. For example, CYT1 promoted expression of transcription factors TWIST1 and SNAIL1 that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HIF1-alpha and HIPPO signaling are mediated, respectively, by binding of ERBB4 to HIF1-alpha and to YAP (Paatero et al., 2012, Komuro et al., 2003). ERBB4 increases activity of the transcription factor SREBF2, resulting in increased expression of SREBF2-target genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The mechanism is not known and may involve facilitation of SREBF2 cleavage through ERBB4-mediated PI3K signaling (Haskins et al. 2016).In some contexts, ERBB4 promotes growth suppression or apoptosis (Penington et al., 2002). Activation of ERBB4 in breast cancer cell lines leads to JNK dependent increase in BRCA1 mRNA level and mitotic cell cycle delay, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Muraoka Cook et al. 2006). The nature of growth responses may be connected with the spliced isoforms expressed. In comparisons of CYT1 vs CYT2 (full-length and ICD) expression in mammary cells, CYT1 was a weaker growth inducer, associated with attenuated MAPK signaling relative to CYT2 (Wali et al., 2014). ERBB4 s80 is also able to translocate to the mitochondrial matrix, presumably when its nuclear translocation is inhibited. Once in the mitochondrion, the BH3 domain of ERBB4, characteristic of BCL2 family members, may enable it to act as a pro apoptotic factor (Naresh et al. 2006).ERBB4 plays important roles in the developing and adult nervous system. Erbb4 deficiency in somatostatin-expressing neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus alters behaviors dependent on sensory selection (Ahrens et al. 2015). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling enhances AMPA receptor responses through PKC-dependent AMPA receptor exocytosis. This results in an increased excitatory input to parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex and regulates visual cortical plasticity (Sun et al. 2016). NRG1-activated ERBB4 signaling is involved in GABAergic activity in amygdala which mediates fear conditioning (fear memory) (Lu et al. 2014). Conditional Erbb4 deletion from fast-spiking interneurons, chandelier and basket cells of the cerebral cortex leads to synaptic defects associated with increased locomotor activity and abnormal emotional, social and cognitive function that can be linked to some of the schizophrenia features. The level of GAD1 (GAD67) protein is reduced in the cortex of conditional Erbb4 mutants. GAD1 is a GABA synthesizing enzyme. Cortical mRNA levels of GAD67 are consistently decreased in schizophrenia (Del Pino et al. 2014). Erbb4 is expressed in the GABAergic neurons of the bed nucleus stria terminalis, a part of the extended amygdala. Inhibition of NRG1-triggered ERBB4 signaling induces anxiety-like behavior, which depends on GABAergic neurotransmission. NRG1-ERBB4 signaling stimulates presynaptic GABA release, but the exact mechanism is not known (Geng et al. 2016). NRG1 protects cortical interneurons against ischemic brain injury through ERBB4-mediated increase in GABAergic transmission (Guan et al. 2015). NRG2-activated ERBB4 can reduce the duration of GABAergic transmission by binding to GABA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane via their GABRA1 subunit and promoting endocytosis of GABA receptors (Mitchell et al. 2013). NRG1 promotes synchronization of prefrontal cortex interneurons in an ERBB4 dependent manner (Hou et al. 2014). NRG1-ERBB4 signaling protects neurons from the cell death induced by a mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Woo et al. 2012).Clinical relevance of ERBB4 has been identified in several contexts. In cancer, putative and validated gain-of-function mutations or gene amplification that may be drivers have been identified at modest frequencies, and may also contribute to resistance to EGFR and ERBB2-targeted therapies. This is noteworthy as ERBB4 kinase activity is inhibited by pan-ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lapatinib, which is approved by the US FDA. The reduced prevalence relative to EGFR and ERBB2 in cancer may reflect more restricted expression of ERBB4, or differential signaling, as specific ERBB4 isoforms have been linked to growth inhibition or apoptosis in experimental systems. ERBB2/ERBB4 heterodimers protect cardiomyocytes, so reduced activity of ERBB4 in patients treated with the ERBB2-targeted therapeutic antibody trastuzumab may contribute to the cardiotoxicity of this agent when used in combination with (cardiotoxic) anthracyclines.With the importance of ERBB4 in developing and adult nervous system, NRG1 and/or ERBB4 polymorphisms, splicing aberrations and mutations have been linked to nervous system disorders including schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although these findings are not yet definitive.Â ",NA,

Particulate antigens have been reported to be more efficiently cross-presented than soluble antigens by DCs (Khor et al. 2008). Particulate antigens are internalized by phagosomes. There are two established models that explain the mechanism by which exogenous particulate antigens are presented through MHC I; the cytosolic pathway where internalized antigens are somehow translocated from phagosomes into cytosol for proteasomal degradation and the vacuolar pathway (Lin et al. 2008, Amigorena et al. 2010).",NA,

Desjardins proposed that ER is recruited to the cell surface, where it fuses with the plasma membrane, underneath phagocytic cups, to supply membrane for the formation of nascent phagosomes (Gagnon et al. 2002). Three independent studies simultaneously showed that ER contributes to the vast majority of phagosome membrane (Guermonprez et al. 2003, Houde et al. 2003, Ackerman et al. 2003). The composition of early phagosome membrane contains ER-resident proteins, the components required for cross-presentation. This model is similar to the phagosome-to-cytosol model in that Ag is translocated to cytosol for proteasomal degradation, but differs in that antigenic peptides are translocated back into the phagosome (instead of ER) for peptide:MHC-I complexes. ER fusion with phagosome introduces molecules that are involved in Ag transport to cytosol (Sec61) and proteasome-generated?peptides back into the phagosome (TAP) for loading onto MHC-I. Although the ER-phagosome pathway is controversial, the concept remains attractive as it explains how peptide-receptive MHC-I molecules could intersect with a relatively high concentration of exogenous antigens, presumably a crucial prerequisite for efficient cross-presentation (Basha et al. 2008).",NA,

However, in some circumstances, antigens from extracellular environment can be presented on MHC class I to stimulate CD8+ T cell immunity, a process termed cross-presentation (Rock & Shen. 2005). Cross-presentation/cross-priming is the ability of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T lymphocytes. Among all the APCs, Dendritic cells (DC) are the dominant antigen cross presenting cell types in vivo, although macrophages and B cells appear to cross present model antigens in vitro with a low degree of efficiency (Amigorena & Savina. 2010, Ackermann & Peter Cresswell. 2004). Compared to macrophages, DCs have low levels of lysosomal proteases and exhibit limited lysosomal degradation (Delamarre et al. 2005). This limited proteolysis of internalized antigens by DCs might contribute to their high efficiency for?cross presentation (Monua & Trombetta. 2007). APCs acquire the exogenous antigens through endocytic mechanisms, especially phagosomes for particulate/cell-associated antigens and endosomes for soluble protein antigens. There does not seem to be a unique pathway for cross-presentation but rather different potential mechanisms of cross-presentation have been proposed. These proposed pathways can be classified according to the location where two key events occur: 1) processing of the antigenic protein and 2) loading of the processed peptide on to MHC I molecule (Blanchard & Shastri. 2010). Based on the requirement for TAP and cytosolic proteases two mechanisms have been described, a cytosolic pathway (TAP-dependent and proteasome-dependent) or a vacuolar pathway (TAP- and proteasome-independent) (Blanchard & Shastri. 2010, Amigorena & Savina. 2010). Regarding peptide-loading, MHC I could be loaded in the ER or in the phagosome and recycled to cell surface (Blanchard & Shastri. 2010). Exogenous soluble antigens are cross-presented by dendritic cells, albeit with lower efficiency than for particulate substrates. Soluble antigens destined for cross-presentation are taken up by distinct endocytosis mechanisms which route them into stable early endosomes and then to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation and peptide loading. The outcome of the cross presentation can be either tolerance or immunity (Rock & Shen. 2005).",NA,

Antigens within the endosome are processed by cathepsin S and other proteases into antigenic peptides. Loading of these peptides onto MHC-I molecules occurs directly within early and late endosomal compartments. Why certain antigens are cross-presented exclusively by the cytosolic pathway while others use the vacuolar pathway is unknown. It may be because some epitopes cannot be generated by endosomal proteolysis, or are completely destroyed. Alternatively, the physical form of the antigen may influence its accessibility to the endosomal or vacuolar pathways (Shen et al. 2004).",NA,

In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue?of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1).

Fe-S protein biogenesis in the mitochondrial matrix involves the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. Ferrous iron is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix by Mitoferrin-1 (SLC25A37) and Mitoferrin-2 (SLC25A28). (Mitoferrin-1 is enriched in erythroid cells while Mitoferrin-2 is ubiquitous.) Frataxin binds ferrous iron in the mitochondrial matrix.

Interaction between NFS1 and ISD11 is necessary for desulfurase activity. Frataxin binds to a complex containing NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU and is proposed to function as an iron donor to ISCU?or as an allosteric switch that activates sulfur transfer and Fe-S cluster assembly (Tsai and Barondeau 2010).

Homo sapiens,R-HSA-140837,Intrinsic Pathway of Fibrin Clot Formation,Hemostasis,Reactome,"Version 81, 2022",8,HMDB0000464,"The intrinsic pathway of blood clotting connects interactions among kininogen (high molecular weight kininogen, HK), prekallikrein (PK), and factor XII to the activation of clotting factor X by a series of reactions that is independent of the extrinsic pathway and that is not subject to inhibition by TFPI. It is thus essential for the prolongation of the clotting cascade: while the reactions of the extrinsic pathway appear to be sufficient to initiate clot formation, those of the intrinsic pathway are required to maintain it (Broze 1995; Davie et al. 1991; Monroe et al. 2002). The intrinsic pathway can be divided into three parts: 1) reactions involving interactions of kininogen, prekallikrein, and factor XII, leading to the activation of factor XII, 2) reactions involving factor XI, factor IX, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) leading to the activation of factors VIII and IX, and 3) reactions that inactivate factor XIIa and kallikrein.Kininogen, prekallikrein, and factor XII?were first identified as proteins needed for the rapid formation of clots when whole blood is exposed to negatively charged surfaces in vitro. Early studies in vitro identified several possible sets of interactions, in which small quantities of one or more of these proteins 'autoactivate' and then catalyze the formation of larger quantities of activated factors. Subsequent work, however, suggests that these factors form complexes on endothelial cell surfaces mediated by C1q binding protein (C1q bp), that the first activation event is the cleavage of prekallikrein by prolylcarboxypeptidase, and that the resulting kallikrein catalyzes the activation of factor XII (Schmaier 2004).The second group of events, occurs in vivo on the surfaces of activated platelets (although most biochemical characterization of the reactions was originally done with purified proteins in solution). Factor XI binds to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib:IX:V complex, where it can be activated by cleavage either by thrombin (generated by reactions of the common pathway) or by activated factor XII (generated in the first part of the intrinsic pathway). Activated factor XI in turn catalyzes the activation of factor IX. Simultaneously, factor VIII, complexed with vWF, is cleaved by thrombin, activating it and causing its release from vWF. Activated factors VIII and IX form a complex on the platelet surface that very efficiently converts factor X to activated factor X. (Activated factors X and V then form a complex that efficiently activates thrombin.)While these two groups of events can be viewed as forming a single functional pathway (e.g., Davie et al. 1991), human clinical genetic data cast doubt on this view. Individuals deficient in kininogen, prekallikrein, or factor XII proteins exhibit normal blood clot formation in vivo. In contrast, deficiencies of factor XI can be associated with failure of blood clotting under some conditions, and deficiencies of vWF, factor VIII, or factor IX cause severe abnormalities - von Willebrand disease, hemophilia A, and hemophilia B, respectively. These data suggest that while the second group of events is essential for normal clot formation in vivo, the first group has a different function (e.g., Schmaier 2004).Finally, reactions neutralize proteins activated in the first part of the intrinsic pathway. Kallikrein forms stable complexes with either C1 inhibitor (C1Inh) or with alpha2-macroglobulin, and factor XIIa forms stable complexes with C1Inh. The relevance of these neutralization events to the regulation of blood clotting is unclear, however. The physiological abnormalities observed in individuals who lack C1Inh appear to be due entirely to abnormalities of complement activation; blood clotting appears to proceed normally. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis, above, that factor XIIa plays a limited role in normal blood clotting under physiological conditions.",NA,

Thrombin also efficiently catalyzes the activation of several factors required earlier in the clotting cascade, thus acting in effect as a positive regulator of clotting. At the same time, thrombin activates protein C, which in turn catalyzes the inactivation of several of these upstream factors, thereby limiting the clotting process. Thrombin can be trapped in stable, inactive complexes with: antithrombin-III (SERPINC1), a circulating blood protein; heparin cofactor II (SERPIND1) which inhibits thrombin in a dermatan sulfate¨Cdependent manner in the arterial vasculature; protein C inhibitor (SERPINA5) that inhibits thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin; and Protease nexin-1 (SERPINE2) that inhibits thrombin at?the vessel wall and platelet surface. The quantitative interplay among these positive and negative modulators is critical to the normal regulation of clotting, facilitating the rapid formation of a protective clot at the site of injury, while limiting and physically confining the process.These events are outlined in the drawing: black arrows connect the substrates (inputs) and products (outputs) of individual reactions, and blue lines connect output activated enzymes to the other reactions that they catalyze.",NA,

The entire clotting cascade can be divided into three portions, the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway, and the common pathway. The extrinsic pathway begins with the release of tissue factor at the site of vascular injury and leads to the activation of factor X. The intrinsic pathway provides an alternative mechanism for activation of factor X, starting from the activation of factor XII.

The receptor for SCF is KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) closely related to the receptors for platelet derived growth factor receptor, colony stimulating factor 1 (Linnekin 1999) and Flt3 (Rosnet et al. 1991). Four isoforms of c-Kit have been identified in humans. Alternative splicing results in isoforms of KIT differing in the presence or absence of four residues (GNNK) in the extracellular region. This occurs due to the use of an alternate 5' splice donor site. These GNNK+ and GNNK- variants are co-expressed in most tissues; the GNNK- form predominates and was more strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and more rapidly internalized (Ronnstrand 2004).?There are also splice variants that arise from alternative usage of splice acceptor site resulting in the presence or absence of a serine residue (Crosier et al., 1993).

The lengths of collagen fibrils in mature tissues are largely unknown but in tendon can be measured in millimetres (Craig et al. 1989). Collagen fibrils isolated from adult bovine corneal stroma had ~350 collagen molecules in transverse section, tapering down to three molecules at the growing tip (Holmes & Kadler 2005). The classical view of collagenases is that they actively unwind the triple helical chain, a process termed molecular tectonics (Overall 2002, Bode & Maskos 2003), before preferentially cleaving the alpha2 chain followed by the remaining chains (Chung et al. 2004). More recently it has been suggested that collagen fibrils exist in an equilibrium between protected and vulnerable states (Stultz 2002, Nerenberg & Stultz 2008). The prototypical triple-helical structure of collagen does not fit into the active site of collagenase MMPs. In addition?the scissile bonds are not solvent-exposed and are therefore inaccessible to the collagenase active site (Chung et al. 2004, Stultz 2002). It was realized that collagen must locally unfold into non-triple helical regions to allow collagenolysis. Observations using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry confirm that there is considerable heterogeneity along collagen fibres (Makareeva et al. 2008) allowing access for MMPs at physiological temperatures (Salsas-Escat et al. 2010).Collagen fibrils with cut chains are unstable and accessible to proteinases that cannot cleave intact collagen strands (Woessner & Nagase 2000, Somerville et al. 2003). Continued degradation leads to the formation of gelatin (Lovejoy et al. 1999). Degradation of collagen types other than I-III is less well characterized but believed to occur in a similar manner. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a major part in the degradation of several extracellular macromolecules including collagens. MMP1 (Welgus et al. 1981), MMP8 (Hasty et al. 1987), and MMP13 (Knauper et al. 1996), sometimes referred to as collagenases I, II and III respectively, are able to initiate the intrahelical cleavage of the major fibril forming collagens I, II and III at neutral pH, and thus thought to define the rate-limiting step in normal tissue remodeling events. All can cleave additional substrates including other collagen subtypes. Collagenases cut collagen alpha chains at a single conserved Gly-Ile/Leu site approximately 3/4 of the molecule's length from the N-terminus (Fields 1991, Chung et al. 2004). The cleavage site is characterised by the motif G(I/L)(A/L); the G-I/L bond is cleaved. In collagen type I this corresponds to G953-I954 in the Uniprot canonical alpha chain sequences (often given as G775-I776 in literature). It is not clear why only this bond is cleaved, as the motif occurs at several other places in the chain. MMP14, a membrane-associated MMP also known as Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT-MMP1), is able to cleave collagen types I, II and III (Ohuchi et al. 1997).",NA,

These reactive oxygen species (superoxide and peroxynitrite) can contribute to increased oxidative stress in the endothelium leading to atherosclerosis and hypertension (Thony et al. 2000, Crabtree and Channon 2011,Schulz et al. 2008, Schmidt and Alp 2007). The synthesis, recycling and effects of BH4 are shown here. Three enzymes are required for the de novo biosynthesis of BH4 and two enzymes for the recycling of BH4.",NA,

They contain a characteristic zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH (Stocker & Bode 1995) and a conserved Methionine which forms a Met-turn. Humans have 24 MMP genes giving rise to 23 MMP proteins, as MMP23 is encoded by two identical genes. All MMPs contain an N-terminal secretory signal peptide and a prodomain with a conserved PRCGXPD motif that in the inactive enzyme is localized with the catalytic site, the cysteine acting as a fourth unpaired ligand for the catalytic zinc atom. Activation involves delocalization of the domain containing this cysteine by a conformational change or proteolytic cleavage, a mechanism referred to as the cysteine-switch (Van Wart & Birkedal-Hansen 1990). Most MMPs are secreted but the membrane type MT-MMPs are membrane anchored and some MMPs may?act on intracellular proteins. Various domains determine substrate specificity, cell localization and activation (Hadler-Olsen et al. 2011). MMPs are regulated by transcription, cellular location (most are not activated until secreted), activating proteinases that can be other MMPs, and by metalloproteinase inhibitors such as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are best known for their role in the degradation and removal of ECM molecules. In addition, cleavage of the ECM and other cell surface molecules can release ECM-bound growth factors, and a number of non-ECM proteins are substrates of MMPs (Nagase et al. 2006). MMPs can be divided into subgroups based on domain structure and substrate specificity but it is clear that these are somewhat artificial, many MMPs belong to more than one functional group (Vise & Nagase 2003, Somerville et al. 2003).",NA,

It is the main component of connective tissue, and the most abundant protein in mammals making up about 25% to 35% of whole-body protein content. A defining feature of collagens is the formation of trimeric left-handed polyproline II-type helical collagenous regions. The packing within these regions is made possible by the presence of the smallest amino acid, glycine, at every third residue, resulting in a repeating motif Gly-X-Y where X is often proline (Pro) and Y often 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp). Gly-Pro-Hyp is the most common triplet in collagen (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Collagen peptide chains also have non-collagenous domains, with collagen subclasses having common chain structures. Collagen fibrils are mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin. Other forms of collagen are abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebralÂ disc. In muscle tissue, collagen is a major component of the endomysium, constituting up to 6% of muscle mass. Gelatin, used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed. On the basis of their fibre architecture in tissues, the genetically distinct collagens have been divided into subgroups. Group 1 collagens have uninterrupted triple-helical domains of about 300 nm, forming large extracellular fibrils. They are referred to as the fibril-forming collagens, consisting of collagens types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII. Group 2 collagens are types IV and VII, which have extended triple helices (>350 nm) with imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat sequences. Group 3 are the short-chain collagens. These have two subgroups. Group 3A have continuous triple-helical domains (type VI, VIII and X). Group 3B have interrupted triple-helical domains, referred to as the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT collagens, Shaw & Olsen 1991). FACITs include collagen IX, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII and XXVI plus the transmembrane collagens (XIII, XVII, XXIII and XXV) and the multiple triple helix domains and interruptions (Multiplexin) collagens XV and XVIII (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004). The non-collagenous domains of collagens have regulatory functions; several are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagen peptides all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N- and C-propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The intact form is referred to as a collagen propeptide, not procollagen, which is used to refer to the trimeric triple-helical precursor of collagen before the propeptides are removed. The C-propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, directs chain association during assembly of the procollagen molecule from its three constituent alpha chains (Hulmes 2002).Fibril forming collagens are the most familiar and best studied subgroup. Collagen fibres are aggregates or bundles of collagen fibrils, which are themselves polymers of tropocollagen complexes, each consisting of three polypeptide chains known as alpha chains. Tropocollagens are considered the subunit of larger collagen structures. They are approximately 300 nm long and 1.5 nm in diameter, with a left-handed triple-helical structure, which becomes twisted into a right-handed coiled-coil 'super helix' in the collagen fibril. Tropocollagens in the extracellular space polymerize spontaneously with regularly staggered ends (Hulmes 2002). In fibrillar collagens the molecules are staggered by about 67 nm, a unit known as D that changes depending upon the hydration state. Each D-period contains slightly more than four collagen molecules so that every D-period repeat of the microfibril has a region containing five molecules in cross-section, called the 'overlap', and a region containing only four molecules, called the 'gap'. The triple-helices are arranged in a hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal array in cross-section, in both the gap and overlap regions (Orgel et al. 2006). Collagen molecules cross-link covalently to each other via lysine and hydroxylysine side chains. These cross-links are unusual, occuring only in collagen and elastin, a related protein.The macromolecular structures of collagen are diverse. Several group 3 collagens associate with larger collagen fibers, serving as molecular bridges which stabilize the organization of the extracellular matrix. Type IV collagen is arranged in an interlacing network within the dermal-epidermal junction and vascular basement membranes. Type VI collagen forms distinct microfibrils called beaded filaments. Type VII collagen forms anchoring fibrils. Type VIII and X collagens form hexagonal networks. Type XVII collagen is a component of hemidesmosomes where it is complexed wtih alpha6Beta4 integrin, plectin, and laminin-332 (de Pereda et al. 2009). Type XXIX collagen has been recently reported to be a putative epidermal collagen with highest expression in suprabasal layers (Soderhall et al. 2007). Collagen fibrils/aggregates arranged in varying combinations and concentrations in different tissues provide specific tissue properties. In bone, collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array with 40 nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits, which probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of crystals of the mineral component, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) with some phosphate. Collagen structure affects cell-cell and cell-matrix communication, tissue construction in growth and repair, and is changed in development and disease (Sweeney et al. 2006, Twardowski et al. 2007). A single collagen fibril can be heterogeneous along its axis, with significantly different mechanical properties in the gap and overlap regions, correlating with the different molecular organizations in these regions (Minary-Jolandan & Yu 2009).",NA,

Cellular membranes contains a distinct composition of various glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), cardiolipin (CL), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysobisphosphatidic acid (also known as bis(monoacylglycerol) hydrogen phosphate - BMP).Glycerophospholipids are first formed by the de novo (Kennedy) pathway using fatty acids activated as acyl-CoA donors. However, the acyl groups of glycerophospholipids are highly diverse and distributed in an asymmetric manner. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are usually esterified at the sn-1 position, whereas?polyunsaturated acyl groups are esterified at the sn-2 position.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), is formed when the phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is hydrolysed by a phospholipase C isozyme.

These seven phosphoinositides, which are heterogeneously distributed within cells, can serve as signature components of different intracellular compartment membranes and so help to mediate specificity of membrane interactions. Phosphoinositide levels are tightly regulated spatially and temporally by the action of various kinases and phosphatases whilst PI(4,5)P2 is also a substrate for phospholipase C. The differential localisation of each of these enzymes on specific compartment membranes ensures?maintenance of the heterogeneous distribution of phosphoinositides despite the continuous membrane flow from one compartment to another.PI is primarily synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum from where the phospholipid is exported to other compartments via membrane traffic or via cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins. Phosphorylation of PI to PI4P primarily occurs in the Golgi, where PI4P plays an important role in the biogenesis of transport vesicles such as the secretory vesicle involved in its transport to the plasma membrane. At this place, PI4P has a major function acting as a precursor of PI(4,5)P2, which is located predominantly at this membrane. PI(4,5)P2 binds and regulates a wide range of proteins that function on the cell surface and serves as a precursor for second messengers. Additionally, it helps define this membrane as a target for secretory vesicles, functions as a coreceptor in endocytic processes, and functions as a cofactor for actin nucleation.At the plasma membrane, PI(4,5)P2 is further phosphorylated to PI(3,4,5)P3, another phosphoinositide with important signalling functions including stimulating cell survival and proliferation. The inositol 3-phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) regenerates PI(4,5)P2, while the 5-phosphatases convert PI(3,4,5)P3 into the phosphoinositide, PI(3,4)P2, propagating the signal initiated by PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4)P2 is further dephosphorylated in the endocytic pathway by inositol 4-phosphatases to PI3P, the signature phosphoinositide of the early endosomal compartment and a ligand for numerous endosomal proteins. However, the bulk of PI3P is generated directly in the endosomes by phosphorylation of PI. The subsequent endosomal phosphorylation of PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 is believed to generate docking sites for recruitment of cytosolic factors responsible for the control of outgoing traffic from the endosomes.

The cofactor used in methylation conjugation is S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is the second most widely used enzyme substrate after ATP and is involved in a wide range of important biological processes. SAM is sythesized from methionine's reaction with ATP, catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). There are two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A, which encode for two homologous MAT catalytic subunits, 1 and 2.During conjugation with nucleophilic substrates, the methyl group attached to the sulfonium ion of SAM is transferred to the substrate forming the conjugate. SAM, having lost the methyl moiety, is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH can be hydrolyzed to form adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine can either be converted to glutathione or methylated to form methionine, thus forming the starting point for SAM synthesis and completing the cycle.Fuctional groups?attacked are phenols, catechols, aliphatic and aromatic amines and sulfhydryl-containing groups.

This is the preferred route of conjugating aromatic amines (R-NH2, converted to aromatic amides R-NH-COCH3) and hydrazines (R-NH-NH2, converted to R-NH-NH-COCH3). Aliphatic amines are not substrates for NAT. The basic reaction is
Acetyl-CoA + an arylamine = CoA + an N- acetylarylamine


NATs are cytosolic and in humans, 2 isoforms are expressed, NAT1 and NAT2. A third isoform, NATP, is a pseudogene and is not expressed. The NAT2 gene contains mutations that decrease NAT2 activity. This mutations was first seen as slow acetylation compared to the normal, fast acetylation of the antituberculosis drug isoniazid. Incidence of the slow acetylator phenotype is high in Middle Eastern populations (70%), average (50%) in Europeans, Americans and Australians and low in Asians (<25% in Chinese, Japanese and Koreans). N-acetylation and methylation pathways differ from other conjugation pathways in that they mask an amine with a nonionizable group so that the conjugates are less water soluble than the parent compound. However, certain N-acetlylations facilitate urinary excretion.
N-acetylation occurs in two sequential steps via a ping-pong Bi-Bi mechanism. In the first step, the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is transferred to a cysteine residue in NAT, with consequent release of coenzyme-A. In the second step, the acetyl group is released from the acetylated NAT to the substrate, subsequently regenerating the enzyme.",NA,

They are composed of 527-530 residues and have a molecular weight of 50-57KDa.The UGT1 family comprises of 9 proteins (UGT1A1, 1A3-1A10) but only 5 have been isolated in humans. Example substrates which are glucuronidated are acetaminophen by UGT1A6 and bilirubin by UGT1A1. Members of the UGT2 subfamily are each encoded by their own genes, in contrast to UGT1As which are encoded at the UGT1 locus. Example substrates are morphine conjugation by UGT2B7 and androgenic steroid conjugation by UGT2B17.Xenobiotics conjugated with glucuronic acid can be substrates for beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme common in gut microflora. This enzyme can release the parent or phase I metabolite which can be reabsorbed. It can then either re-exert it's original effects or be conjugated by glucuronic acid again. This cycle is called enterohepatic circulation and can delay the elimination of the xenobiotic",NA,

They can be found in the cytosol as well as being microsomal membrane-bound. Cytosolic GSTs are encoded by at least 5 gene families (alpha, mu, pi, theta and zeta GST) whereas membrane-bound enzymes are encoded by single genes. Soluble GSTs are homo- or hetero-dimeric enzymes (approximately 25KDa subunits) which can act on a wide range of endogenous and exogenous electrophiles. GSTs mediate conjugation using glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide synthesized from its precursor amino acids gamma-glutamate, cysteine and glycine. A generalized reaction isRX + GSH -> HX + GSRGlutathione conjugates are excreted in bile and converted to cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates in the intestine and kidneys. GSH is the major, low molecular weight, non-protein thiol synthesized de novo in mammalian cells. As well as taking part in conjugation reactions, GSH also has antioxidant ability and can metabolize?endogenous and exogenous compounds. The nucleophilic GSH attacks the electrophilic substrate forming a thioether bond between the cysteine residue of GSH and the electrophile. The result is generally a less reactive and more water-soluble conjugate that can be easily excreted. In some cases, GSTs can activate compounds to reactive species such as certain haloalkanes and haloalkenes. Substrates for GSTs include epoxides, alkenes and compounds with electrophilic carbon, sulfur or nitrogen centres. There are two types of conjugation reaction with glutathione: displacement reactions where glutathione displaces an electron-withdrawing group and addition reactions where glutathione is added to activated double bond structures or strained ring systems",NA,

This might be achieved by bringing inhibitory 3' UTR-binding proteins into a position in which they interfere either with the function of the translation initiation complex or with the assembly of the ribosome (Mazumder et al 2001). Translational silencing of Ceruloplasmin (Cp) occurs 16 hrs after its induction by INF-gamma (Mazumder et al., 1997). Although the mechanism by which silencing occurs has not yet been determined, this process is mediated by the L13a subunit of the 60s ribosome and thought to require circularization of the Cp mRNA (Sampath et al., 2003; Mazumder et al., 2001; Mazumder et al., 2003). Between 14 and 16 hrs after INF gamma induction, the L13a subunit of the 60s ribosome is phosphorylated and released from the 60s subunit.

The next available codon on the mRNA is exposed in the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) binding site (A site) on the 30S subunit.A: Ternary complexes of aa -tRNA:eEF1A:GTP enter the ribosome and enable the anticodon of the tRNA to make a codon/anticodon interaction with the A-site codon of the mRNA. B: Upon cognate recognition, the eEF1A:GTP is brought into the GTPase activating center of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed and eEF1A:GDP leaves the ribosome. C: The peptidyl transferase center of ribosome catalyses the formation of a peptide bond between the incoming amino acid and the peptide found in the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site). D: In the pre-translocation state of the ribosome, the eEF2:GTP enters the ribosome, physically translocating the peptidyl-tRNA out of the A site to P site and leaves the ribosome eEF2:GDP. This action of eEF2:GTP accounts?for the precise movement of the mRNA by 3 nucleotides.Consequently, deacylated tRNA is shifted to the E site. A ribosome associated ATPase activity is proposed to stimulate the release of deacylated tRNA from the E site subsequent to translocation (Elskaya et al., 1991). In this post-translocation state, the ribosome is now ready to receive a new ternary complex.This process is illustrated below with: an amino acyl-tRNA with an amino acid, a peptidyl-tRNA with a growing peptide, a deacylated tRNA with an -OH, and a ribosome with A,P and E sites to accommodate these three forms of tRNA.",NA,

NSP is involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and specification. For example, it is utilised by continually renewing adult tissues such as blood, skin, and gut epithelium not only to maintain stem cells in a proliferative, pluripotent, and undifferentiated state but also to direct the cellular progeny to adopt different developmental cell fates. Analogously, it is used during embryonic development to create fine-grained patterns of differentiated cells, notably during neurogenesis where the NSP controls patches such as that of the vertebrate inner ear where individual hair cells are surrounded by supporting cells.This process is known as lateral inhibition: a molecular mechanism whereby individual cells within a field are stochastically selected to adopt particular cell fates and the NSP inhibits their direct neighbours from doing the same. The NSP has been adopted?by several other biological systems for binary cell fate choice. In addition, the NSP is also used during vertebrate segmentation to divide the growing embryo into regular blocks called somites which eventually form the vertebrae. The core of this process relies on regular pulses of Notch signaling generated from a molecular oscillator in the presomatic mesoderm.The Notch receptor is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as a single polypeptide precursor. Newly synthesized Notch receptor is proteolytically cleaved in the trans-golgi network, creating a heterodimeric mature receptor comprising of non-covalently associated extracellular and transmembrane subunits. This assembly travels to the cell surface ready to interact with specific ligands. Following ligand activation and further proteolytic cleavage, an intracellular domain is released and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression",NA,

Telomeric DNA in humans, as in many eukaryotic organisms, consists of tandem repeats (Blackburn and Gall 1978; Moyzis et al. 1988; Meyne et al. 1989). The repeats at human telomeres are composed of TTAGGG sequences and stretch for several kilobase pairs. Another feature of telomeric DNA in many eukaryotes is a G-rich 3' single strand overhang, which in humans is estimated to be approximately 50-300 bases long (Makarov et al. 1997; Wright et al. 1997; Huffman et al. 2000). Telomeric DNA isolated from humans and several other organisms can form a lasso-type structure called a t-loop in which the 3' single-strand end is presumed to invade the double stranded telomeric DNA repeat tract (Griffith et al. 1999). Telomeric DNA is bound by multiple protein factors that play important roles in regulating telomere length and in protecting the chromosome end from recombination, non-homologous?end-joining, DNA damage signaling, and unregulated nucleolytic attack (reviewed in de Lange 2005).DNA attrition can occur at telomeres, which can impact cell viability. Attrition can occur owing to the ""end-replication problem"", a consequence of the mechanism of lagging-strand synthesis (Watson 1972; Olovnikov 1973). Besides incomplete replication, nucleolytic processing also likely contributes to telomere attrition (Huffman et al. 2000). If telomeres become critically shortened, replicative senescence can result (Harley et al. 1990). Thus, in order to undergo multiple divisions, cells need a mechanism to replenish the sequence at their chromosome ends.The primary means for maintaining the sequence at chromosome ends in many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, is based on telomerase (Greider and Blackburn, 1985; Morin 1989). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex minimally composed of a conserved protein subunit containing a reverse transcriptase domain (telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT) (Lingner et al. 1997; Nakamura et al. 1997) and a template-containing RNA (telomerase RNA component, TERC, TR, TER) (Greider and Blackburn, 1987; Feng et al 1995). Telomerase uses the RNA template to direct addition of multiple tandem repeats to the 3' G-rich single strand overhang. Besides extension by telomerase, maintenance of telomeric DNA involves additional activities, including C-strand synthesis, which fills in the opposing strand, and nucleolytic processing, which likely contributes to the generation of the 3' overhang",NA,

Additional metabolic pathways allow the interconversion of nucleotides, the salvage and reutilization of nucleotides released by degradation of DNA and RNA, the catabolism of excess nucleotides, and the transport of these molecules between the cytosol and the nucleus (Rudolph 1994). These pathways are regulated to control the total size of the intracellular nucleotide pool, to balance the relative amounts of individual nucleotides, and to couple the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides to the onset of DNA replication (S phase of the cell cycle).These pathways are also of major clinical interest as they are the means by which nucleotide analogues used as anti-viral?and anti-tumor drugs are taken up by cells, activated, and catabolized (Weilin and Nordlund 2010).

It is hypothesized that calcium influx and energy depletion are the signals that initiate changes in gene expression leading to new mitochondrial proteins. Energy depletion causes a reduction in ATP and an increase in AMP which activates AMPK. AMPK in turn phosphorylates the coactivator PGC-1alpha (PPARGC1A), one of the master regulators of mitochondrial biosynthesis. Likewise, p38 MAPK is activated by muscle contraction (possibly via calcium and CaMKII) and phosphorylates PGC-1alpha. CaMKIV responds to intracellular calcium by phosphorylating CREB, which activates expression of PGC-1alpha.Deacetylation of PGC-1alpha?by SIRT1 may also play a role in activation (Canto et al. 2009, Gurd et al. 2011), however Sirt11 deacetylation of Ppargc1a in mouse impacted genes related to glucose metabolism rather than mitochondrial biogenesis (Rodgers et al. 2005) and mice lacking SIRT1 in muscle had normal levels of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise (Philp et al. 2011) so the role of deacetylation is not fully defined.

HIV-1 reverse transcription takes place in the cytosol of a newly infected host cell and involves multiple steps of RNA synthesis and degradation of the RNA strand of RNA:DNA duplexes mediated by the HIV-1 RT protein, as well as two template switches, to yield a DNA duplex colinear with the viral genomic RNA but with additional Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequence motifs at both ends (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997; Jonckheere et al. 2000).HIV-1 RT has two catalytic activities essential for transcription of a DNA duplex copy of the viral genomic RNA: a reverse transcriptase activity and an RNase H activity. The reverse transcriptase is primer dependent and can transcribe both RNA and DNA templates in a 5'-3' direction. The RNaseH?acts on the RNA strand of RNA:DNA duplexes and can catalyze both endo- and exonucleolytic cleavage of such an RNA strand. RT is a heterodimer of 66 and 51 kD polypeptides, both generated by cleavage of the HIV-1 Pol gene product: p66 contains Pol amino acid residues 599-1158; p51 contains residues 599-1038. Both active sites of the HIV-1 RT enzyme are contained in the p66 polypeptide, the polymerase activity in its aminoterminal region, and the RNase in its carboxyterminus.

The assembly of viral particles will be covered in a later release of Reactome. HIV-1 gene expression is regulated by both cellular and viral proteins. Although the initial activation of the HIV-1 transcription is facilitated by cellular transcription factors including NF-kappa B (Nabel and Baltimore, 1987), this activation results in the production of primarily short transcripts (Kao et al., 1987). Expression of high levels of the full length HIV-1 transcript requires the function of the HIV-1 Tat protein which promotes elongation of the HIV-1 transcript (reviewed in Karn, 1999; Taube et al. 1999; Liou et al., 2004; Barboric and Peterlin 2005).

In mammalian cells, Golgi apparatus consists of stacked cisternae that are connected by tubules to form a ribbon-like structure in the perinuclear region, in vicinity of the centrosome. Reorganization of the Golgi apparatus during cell division allows both daughter cells to inherit this organelle, and may play additional roles in the organization of the mitotic spindle. First changes in the structure of the Golgi apparatus likely start in G2 and are subtle, involving unlinking of the Golgi ribbon into separate stacks. These changes are required for the entry of mammalian cells into mitosis (Sutterlin et al. 2002). This initial unlinking of the Golgi ribbon depends on GRASP proteins and on CTBP1 (BARS) protein, which induces the cleavage of the tubular membranes connecting the stacks (Hidalgo Carcedo et al. 2004, Colanzi et al. 2007), but the exact mechanism is not known. Activation?of MEK1/2 also contributes to unlinking of the Golgi ribbon in G2 (Feinstein and Linstedt 2007). From prophase to metaphase, Golgi cisternae undergo extensive fragmentation that is a consequence of unstacking of Golgi cisternae and cessation of transport through Golgi. At least three mitotic kinases, CDK1, PLK1 and MEK1, regulate these changes. CDK1 in complex with cyclin B phosphorylates GOLGA2 (GM130) and GORASP1 (GRASP65), constituents of a cis-Golgi membrane complex (Lowe et al. 1998, Preisinger et al. 2005). Phosphorylation of GOLGA2 prevents binding of USO1 (p115), a protein localizing to the membrane of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) to Golgi transport vesicles and cis-Golgi, thereby impairing fusion of these vesicles with cis-Golgi cisternae and stopping ER to Golgi transport (Lowe et al. 1998, Seeman et al. 2000, Moyer et al. 2001). Phosphorylation of GORASP1 by CDK1 enables further phosphorylation of GORASP1 by PLK1 (Sutterlin et al. 2001, Preisinger et al. 2005). Phosphorylation of GORASP1 by CDK1 and PLK1 impairs stacking of Golgi cisternae by interfering with formation of GORASP1 trans-oligomers that would normally link the Golgi cisternae together (Wang et al. 2003, Wang et al. 2005, Sengupta and Linstedt 2010). In the median Golgi, GORASP2 (GRASP55), a protein that forms a complex with BLFZ1 (Golgin-45) and RAB2A GTPase and contributes to cisternae stacking and Golgi trafficking (Short et al. 2001), is also phosphorylated in mitosis. Phosphorylation of GORASP2 by MEK1/2-activated MAPK1 (ERK2) and/or MAPK3-3 (ERK1b in human, Erk1c in rat) contributes to Golgi unlinking in G2 and fragmentation of Golgi cisternae in mitotic prophase (Acharya et al. 1998, Jesch et al. 2001, Colanzi et al. 2003, Shaul and Seger 2006, Duran et al. 2008, Feinstein and Linstedt 2007, Feinstein and Linstedt 2008, Xiang and Wang 2010).",NA,

HIV damages the immune system, leaving the infected person vulnerable to a variety of ""opportunistic"" infections arising from host immune impairment (Hare, 2004).HIV-1 and the less common HIV-2 belong to the family of retroviruses. HIV-1 contains a single-stranded RNA genome that is 9 kilobases in length and contains 9 genes that encode 15 different proteins. These proteins are classified as: structural proteins (Gag, Pol, and Env), regulatory proteins (Tat?and Rev), and accessory proteins (Vpu, Vpr, Vif, and Nef) (Frankel and Young,1998).HIV infection cycle can be divided into two phases:1.

It has additional roles in embryonic development, removal of apoptotic cells or organelles, antigen presentation, protection against toxins and as a degradation route for aggregate-prone proteins and infectious agents. The dysregulation of autophagy is involved in several human diseases, for example, Crohn's disease, cancer and neurodegeneration (Ravikumar et al. 2010).Autophagy is highly conserved from yeast to humans; much of the machinery was first identified in yeast (see Klionsky et al. 2011). Initially, double-membraned cup-shaped structures called the isolation membrane or phagophore engulf portions of cytoplasm. The membranes fuse to form the autophagosome. In yeast cells, autophagosomes are formed at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) next to the vacuole. In mammals, autophagosomes appear throughout the cytoplasm then?move along microtubules towards the microtubule-organising centre. This transport requires microtubules and the function of dynein motor proteins; depolymerization of microtubules or inhibition of dynein-dependent transport results in inhibition of autophagy (Kochl et al. 2006, Kimura et al. 2008). Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes whose contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (Mizushima et al. 2011).The origins of the autophagosomal membrane and the incorporation of existing membrane material have been extensively debated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes have all been implicated in the nucleation of the isolation membrane and subsequent growth of the membrane (Lamb et al. 2013). Recently 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes has shown the cup-shaped isolation membrane tightly sandwiched between two sheets of ER and physically connected to the ER through a narrow membrane tube (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009). This suggests that isolation membrane formation and elongation are guided by adjacent ER sheets, supporting the now prevalent 'ER cradle' model, which suggests that the isolation membrane arises from the ER (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).Autophagy is tightly regulated. The induction of autophagy in response to starvation is partly mediated by inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Noda & Ohsumi 1998) and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while energy loss induces autophagy by activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Other pathways regulating autophagy are regulated by calcium, cyclic AMP, calpains and the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (Rubinsztein et al. 2012). In mammals, two complexes cooperatively produce the isolation membrane. The ULK complex consists of ULK1/2, ATG13, (FIP200) and ATG101 (Alers et al. 2012). The PIK3C3-containing Beclin-1 complex consists of PIK3C3 (Vps34), BECN1 (Beclin-1, Atg6), PIK3R4 (p150, Vps15) and ATG14 (Barkor) (Matsunaga et al. 2009, Zhong et al. 2009). A similar complex where ATG14 is replaced by UVRAG functions later in autophagosome maturation and endocytic traffic (Itakura et al. 2008, Liang et al. 2008). Binding of KIAA0226 to this complex negatively regulates the maturation process (Matsunaga et al. 2009). The ULK and Beclin-1 complexes are recruited to specific autophagosome nucleation regions where they stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) production and facilitate the elongation and initial membrane curvature of the phagophore membrane (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015).The ULK complex is considered the most upstream component of the mammalian autophagy pathway (Itakura & Mizushima 2010), acting as an integrator of the autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1. It is not fully understood how ULK1 is modulated in response to environmental cues. Phosphorylation plays an essential role (Dunlop & Tee 2013) but it is not clear how phosphorylation regulates ULK1 activities (Ravikumar et al. 2010). ULK1 kinase activity is required for autophagy, but the substrate(s) of ULK1 that mediate its autophagic function are not certain. ULK1 may also have kinase-independent functions in autophagy (Wong et al. 2013). PIK3C3 (Vps34) is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that produces PI3P. It is essential for the early stages of autophagy and colocalizes strongly with early autophagosome markers (Axe et al. 2008). BECN1 binds several further proteins that affect autophagosome formation. Partners that induce autophagy include AMBRA1 (Fimia et al. 2007), UVRAG (Liang et al. 2006) and SH3GLB1 (Takahashi et al. 2007). Binding of BCL2 or BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) inhibit autophagy (Pattingre et al. 2005, Ciechomska et al. 2009). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor complex that binds BCL2 also interacts with BECN1, inhibiting autophagy (Vincencio et al. 2009). CISD2 (Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1, NAF1), a component in the IP3R complex, interacts with BCL2 at the ER and stabilizes the BCL2-BECN1 interaction (Chang et al. 2010). Starvation leads to activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1), which results in the phosphorylation of BCL2 and BCL2L1, which release their binding to BECN1 and thus induces autophagosome formation (Wei et al. 2008). AMBRA1 can simultaneously bind dynein and the Beclin-1 complex. During nutrient starvation, AMBRA1 is phosphorylated in a ULK1-dependent manner (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). This phosphorylation releases AMBRA1-associated Beclin-1 complexes from dynein and the microtubule network, freeing the complex to translocate to autophagy initiation sites (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010). A characteristic of this early phase of autophagosome formation is the formation of PI3P-enriched ER-associated structures called omegasomes (Axe et al. 2008) or cradles (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009). Omegasomes appear to concentrate at or near the connected mitochondria-associated ER membrane (Hamasaki et al. 2013). However, the phagophore also can incorporate existing material from other membrane sources such as ER exit sites (ERES), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). Omegasomes lead to the formation of the isolation membrane or phagophore, which is thought to form de novo by an unknown mechanism (Simonsen & Stenmark 2008, Roberts & Ktistakis 2013). Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes and semi-autonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).ATG9 is a direct target of ULK1. In nutrient-rich conditions mammalian ATG9 is localized to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (including early, late and recycling endosomes), whereas under starvation conditions it is localized to autophagosomes, in a process that is dependent on ULK1 (Young et al. 2006). ATG9 is believed to play a role in the delivery of vesicles derived from existing membranes to the expanding phagophore (Lamb et al. 2013). Yeast Atg9 forms a complex with Atg2 and Atg18 (Reggiori et al. 2004). PI3P produced at the initiation site is sensed by WIPI2b, the mammalian homologue of Atg18 (Polson et al. 2010). WIPI2b then recruits Atg16L1 (Dooley et al. 2014). There are four WIPI proteins in mammalian cells (Proikas-Cezanne et al. 2015). They are all likely bind PI3P and be recruited to membranes but the function of WIPI1, 3 and 4 in autophagy is not yet clear. WIPI4 (WDR45) has been shown to bind Atg2 and to be involved in lipid droplet formation (Velikkakath et al. 2012); mutations in WIPI4 have been shown to cause a neurodegenerative disease (Saitsu et al. 2013).The elongation of the membrane that will become the autophagosome is regulated by two ubiquitination-like reactions. First, the ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7, which acts as an E1-like activating enzyme, and ATG10, which has a role similar to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The ATG5:ATG12 complex then interacts non-covalently with ATG16L1. This complex associates with the forming autophagosome but dissociates from completed autophagosomes (Geng & Klionski 2008). The second ubiquitin-like reaction involves the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules of the LC3 family (Weidberg et al. 2010). LC3 proteins are conjugated through their C-terminal glycine residues with PE by the E1-like ATG7 and E2-like ATG3. This allows LC3 proteins to associate with the autophagosome membrane. The ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L1 complex (Mizushima et al., 2011) acts as an E3 like enzyme for the conjugation of LC3 family proteins (mammalian homologues of yeast Atg8) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Hanada et al. 2007, Fujita et al. 2008). LC3 PE can be deconjugated by the protease ATG4 (Li et al. 2011, 2012). ATG4 is also responsible for priming LC3 proteins by cleaving the C terminus to expose a glycine residue (Kirisako et al, 2000, Scherz Shouval et al. 2007). LC3 proteins remain associated with autophagosomes until they fuse with lysosomes. The LC3-like proteins inside the resulting autolysosomes are degraded, while those on the cytoplasmic surface are delipidated and recycled. ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-negative vesicles represent pre-autophagosomal structures (pre-phagophores and possibly early phagophores), ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-positive LC3-positive structures can be considered to be phagophores, and ATG5:ATG12:ATG16L1-negative LC3-positive vesicles can be regarded as mature autophagosomes (Tandia et al. 2011).Phagophore expansion is probably mediated by membrane uptake from endomembranes as well as from semiautonomous organelles (Lamb et al. 2013, Shibutani & Yoshimori 2014).The mechanisms involved in the closure of the phagophore membrane are poorly understood. As the phagophore is a double-membraned structure, its closure involves the fusion of a narrow opening, a process that is distinct from other membrane fusion events (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). The topology of the phagophore is similar to that of cytokinesis, viral budding or multivesicular body (MVB) formation. These processes rely on the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) (Rusten et al. 2012). ESCRT and associated proteins facilitate membrane budding away from the cytosol and subsequent cleavage of the bud neck (Hurley & Hanson 2010). Several studies have shown that depletion of ESCRT subunits or the regulatory ATPase Vps4 causes an accumulation of autophagosomes (Filimonenko et al. 2007, Rusten et al. 2007) but it is not clear whether ESCRTs are required for autophagosome closure or for autophagosome to endosome fusion. UVRAG is also involved in the maturation step, recruiting proteins that bring about membrane fusion such as the class C Vps proteins, which activate Rab7 thereby promoting fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes (Liang et al. 2008).",NA,

When blood glucose levels rise, insulin release stimulates glucose uptake from the blood, glucose breakdown (glycolysis), and glucose storage as glycogen. When blood glucose levels fall, glucagon release stimulates glycogen breakdown and de novo glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis), while inhibiting glycolysis and glycogen synthesis.At a molecular level, the binding of glucagon to the extracellular face of its receptor causes conformational changes in the receptor that allow the dissociation and activation of subunits Gs and Gq. The activation of Gq leads to the activation of phospholipase C, production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, and subsequent release of intracellular calcium. The activation of Gs leads to activation of adenylate cyclase, an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, and activation of protein kinase A?(PKA). Active PKA phosphorylates key enzymes of glycogenolysis, glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, modifying their activities. These signal transduction events, and some of their downstream consequences, are illustrated below (adapted from Jiang and Zhang, 2003).",NA,

A central part in this regulation is played by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a neutral lipase abundant in adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also abundant in ovarian and adrenal tissue, where it mediates cholesterol ester hydrolysis, yielding cholesterol for steroid biosynthesis. The hormones to which it is sensitive include catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine), ACTH, and glucagon, all of which trigger signaling cascades that lead to its phosphorylation and activation, and insulin, which sets off events leading to its dephosphorylation and inactivation (Holm et al. 2000; Kraemer and Shen 2002).The processes of triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis are also regulated by subcellular compartmentalization: these lipids are packaged in cytosolic particles and the enzymes responsible for their hydrolysis, and perhaps for additional steps in their metabolism, are organized at the surfaces of these particles (e.g., Brasaemle et al. 2004). This organization is dynamic: the inactive form of HSL is not associated with the particles, but is translocated there after being phosphorylated. Conversely, perilipin, a major constituent of the particle surface, appears to block access of enzymes to the lipids within the particle; its phosphorylation allows greater access. Here, HSL-mediated triacylglycerol hydrolysis is described as a pathway containing twelve reactions. The first six of these involve activation: phosphorylation of HSL, dimerization of HSL, disruption of CGI-58:perilipin complexes at the surfaces of cytosolic lipid particles, phosphorylation of perilipin, association of phosphorylated HSL with FABP, and translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the surfaces of lipid particles. The next four reactions are the hydrolysis reactions themselves: the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, and the successive removal of three fatty acids from triacylglycerol. The last two reactions, dephosphorylation of perilipin and HSL, negatively regulate the pathway. These events are outlined in the figure below. Inputs (substrates) and outputs (products) of individual reactions are connected by black arrows; blue lines connect output activated enzymes to the other reactions that they catalyze. Despite the undoubted importance of these reactions in normal human energy metabolism and in the pathology of diseases such as type II diabetes, they have been studied only to a limited extent in human cells and tissues.

While insulin mediates the storage of excess nutrients, glucagon is involved in the mobilization of energy resources in response to low blood glucose levels, principally by stimulating hepatic glucose output. Small doses of glucagon are sufficient to induce significant glucose elevations. These hormone-driven regulatory pathways enable the body to sense and respond to changed amounts of nutrients in the blood and demands for energy.Glucagon and Insulin act through various metabolites and enzymes that target specific steps in metabolic pathways for sugar and fatty acids. The processes responsible for the long-term control of fat synthesis and short term control of glycolysis by key metabolic products and enzymes are annotated in this module as six specific pathways:Pathway 1. Glucagon signalling in metabolic?pathways: In response to low blood glucose, pancreatic alpha-cells release glucagon. The binding of glucagon to its receptor results in increased cAMP synthesis, and Protein Kinase A (PKA) activation.Pathway 2. PKA mediated phosphorylation:PKA phosphorylates key enzymes, e.g., 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase /Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PF2K-Pase) at serine 36, and regulatory proteins, e.g., Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) at serine 196 and threonine 666.In brief, the binding of insulin to its receptor leads to increased protein phosphatase activity and to hydrolysis of cAMP by cAMP phosphodiesterase. These events counteract the regulatory effects of glucagon.Pathway 3: Insulin stimulates increased synthesis of Xylulose-5-phosphate (Xy-5-P). Activation of the insulin receptor results indirectly in increased Xy-5-P synthesis from Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and Fructose-6-phosphate. Xy-5-P, a metabolite of the pentose phosphate pathway, stimulates protein phosphatase PP2A.Pathway 4: AMP Kinase (AMPK) mediated response to high AMP:ATP ratio: In response to diet with high fat content or low energy levels, the cytosolic AMP:ATP ratio is increased. AMP triggers a complicated cascade of events. In this module we have annotated only the phosphorylation of ChREBP by AMPK at serine 568, which inactivates this transcription factor.Pathway 5: Dephosphorylation of key metabolic factors by PP2A: Xy-5-P activated PP2A efficiently dephosphorylates phosphorylated PF2K-Pase resulting in the higher output of F-2,6-P2 that enhances PFK activity in the glycolytic pathway. PP2A also dephosphorylates (and thus activates) cytosolic and nuclear ChREBP.Pathway 6: Transcriptional activation of metabolic genes by ChREBP: Dephosphorylated ChREBP activates the transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism such as pyruvate kinase, and lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, acyl CoA synthase and glycerol phosphate acyl transferase.

KS can perform a structural function and is found in bone, cartilage and the cornea. In joints, it also acts as a shock absorber due to its highly hydrated nature. There are several classes of KS, KSI, II and III. KSI is N-linked to asparagine (Asn) residues in the core protein and is predominantly found in the cornea. KSII is O-linked to serine (Ser) or Thr (threonine) residues in the core protein and is found predominantly in cartilage linked to the protein aggrecan, forming the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage.

Proline and lysine residues may be hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this and of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1972, 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation. Collagen peptides all have non-collagenous domains; collagens within the subclasses have common chain structures. These non-collagenous domains have regulatory functions; some are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain.?Fibrillar collagens all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N and C propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The C propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, is highly conserved. It directs chain association during intracellular assembly of the procollagen molecule from three collagen propeptide alpha chains (Hulmes 2002). The N-propeptide has a short linker (NC2) connecting the main triple helix to a short minor one (COL2) and a globular N-terminal region NC3. NC3 domains are variable both in size and the domains they contain.Collagen propeptides typically undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues are hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase may also have a role in alpha chain association as no association of the C-propeptides of type XII collagen was seen in the presence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors (Mazzorana et al. 1993, 1996). In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this is species dependent, lower hydroxylation correlating with lower ambient temperature and thermal stability (Cohen-Solal et al. 1986, Notbohm et al. 1992). Similarly the extent of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation.Collagen molecules fold and assemble through a series of distinct intermediates (Bulleid 1996). Individual collagen polypeptide chains are translocated co-translationally across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intra-chain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (Kivirikko et al. 1992). When the peptide chain is fully translocated into the ER lumen the C-propeptide folds, the conformation being stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds (Doege and Fessler 1986). Pro alpha-chains associate via the C-propeptides (Byers et al. 1975, Bachinger et al. 1978), or NC2 domains for FACIT family collagens (Boudko et al. 2008) to form an initial trimer which can be stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds (Schofield et al. 1974, Olsen et al. 1976), though these are not a prerequisite for further folding (Bulleid et al. 1996). The triple helix then nucleates and folds in a C- to N- direction. The association of the individual chains and subsequent triple helix formation are distinct steps (Bachinger et al. 1980). The N-propeptides associate and in some cases form inter-chain disulfide bonds (Bruckner et al., 1978). Procollagen is released via carriers into the exracellular space (Canty & Kadler 2005). Fibrillar procollagens undergo removal of the C- and N-propeptides by procollagen C and N proteinases respectively, both Zn2+ dependent metalloproteinases. Propeptide processing is a required step for normal collagen I and III fibril formation, but collagens can retain some or all of their non-collagenous propeptides. Retained collagen type V and XI N-propeptides contribute to the control of fibril growth by sterically limiting lateral molecule addition (Fichard et al. 1995). Processed fibrillar procollagen is termed tropocollagen, which is considered to be the unit of higher order fibrils and fibres. Tropocollagens of the fibril forming collagens I, II, III, V and XI sponteneously aggregate in vitro in a manner that has been compared with crystallization, commencing with a nucleation event followed by subsequent organized aggregation (Silver et al. 1992, Prockop & Fertala 1998). Fibril formation is stabilized by lysyl oxidase catalyzed crosslinks between adjacent molecules (Siegel & Fu 1976).",NA,

Mammals have three AKT genes, named RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1, PKB, PKB-alpha), RAC-beta serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT2, PKB-beta and RAC-gamma serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT3, PKB-gamma, STK2).

The PH domain interacts with membrane lipid products such as phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) produced by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). Biochemical analysis. The PH domain of AKT binds to PIP3 and PIP2 with similar affinity (James et al. 1996, Frech et al. 1997). The kinase catalytic domain of Akt/PKB is highly similar to other AGC kinases (Peterson & Schreiber 1999). Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in this region (T308 in AKT1) results in partial activation (Alessi et al. 1996). The carboxyl terminal extension has the hydrophobic motif FPQFSY. Phosphorylation of serine or threonine residue in this motif is necessary for full kinase activation. Deletion of this motif completely abolishes activity (Andjelkovi? et al. 1997).",NA,

Phosphorylation of complexed TSC2 by PKB induces degradation of both TSC1 and TSC2 through the proteosome pathway (Dan et al. 2002).

LPS is assembled within diverse Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are human or plant pathogens. It is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and consists of lipid A, a core polysaccharide and an O-polysaccharide of variable length (often more than 50 monosaccharide units). LPS is a potent activator of the innate immune response in humans, causing reactions including fever, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, changes in leukocyte and platelet counts, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiorgan failure, shock and death. All these reactions are induced by cytokines and other endogenous mediators which are produced after interaction of LPS with the humoral and cellular targets of the host. In macrophages and dendritic cells, LPS-mediated activation of TLR4 triggers the biosynthesis of diverse mediators of inflammation, such?as TNF-alpha and IL6, and activates the production of co-stimulatory molecules required for the adaptive immune response. In mononuclear and endothelial cells, LPS also stimulates tissue factor production. These events are desirable for clearing local infections, but when these various mediators and clotting factors are overproduced, they can damage small blood vessels and precipitate shock accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. TLR4 is unique among the TLR family in its ability to recruit four adapters to activate two distinct signaling pathways. One pathway is activated by the pair of the adapters Mal or TIRAP (Toll/interleukin-1-receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adapter protein) and MyD88, which leads to the NFkB activation and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The second pathway is activated by the adapters TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter protein inducing interferon-beta) and TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule). The combined use of TRIF and TRAM adapters is specific for TLR4 signaling pathway and leads to the induction of type I interferons and delayed activation of NFkB.The previous model of TLR4 signaling pathway described the simultaneous activation of these two signaling pathways at the plasma membrane, however the later studies suggested that upon activation TLR4 first induces TIRAP-MyD88 signaling at the plasma membrane and is then endocytosed and activates TRAM-TRIF signaling from the early endosome [Kagan JC et al 2008; Tanimura N et al 2008; Zanoni I et al 2011].",NA,

Physiological conditions include thermogenesis, fatty acid metabolism and protection against free radicals and ageing; pathological conditions include involvement in obesity, diabetes and degenerative, neurological and immunological diseases.The UCPs share general structural features with the other mitochondrial transport carriers. They have a tripartite structure, consisting of three homologous sequence repeats of approximately 100 residues. The carriers also have a signature motif, which is repeated in all members of the family and in all three repeats. The transmembrane arrangement of UCPs is 6 alpha-helix regions (2 regions per repeat) spanning the lipid bilayer with the amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytosolic side. The crystal structure of one member of the family, the adenine nucleotide translocase, is?known, and UCPs can be successfully folded into this structure to indicate their probable 3D arrangement (Pebay-Peyroula et al. 2003, Kunji 2004, Esteves & Brand 2005).The most studied member of the family, UCP1, catalyzes adaptive thermogenesis (i.e. heat generation) in mammalian brown adipose tissue. It does so by promoting a leak of protons through the mitochondrial inner membrane, which uncouples ATP production from substrate oxidation, leading to fast oxygen consumption and ultimately to heat production. The thermogenic activity of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue plays an important role when the organism needs extra heat, e.g. during cold weather conditions (for small rodents), the cold stress of birth or arousal from hibernation. UCP1 homologs have been found in lower vertebrates such as fish, where their role is unclear (Cannon & Nedergaard 2004, Jastroch et al. 2005).The proton conductance of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue is tightly controlled. It is strongly inhibited by physiological concentrations of purine nucleotides. This inhibition is overcome by fatty acids, which are released from intracellular triacylglycerol stores following adrenergic activation in response to cold or overfeeding. Other activators include superoxide, retinoic acid, the retinoid 4-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetra-methyl-2-naphtalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNPB) and reactive alkenals, such as hydroxynonenal. UCP2 and UCP3 have high amino acid sequence homology to UCP1 (59 and 57% amino-acid identity respectively). UCP2 has been identified in lung, spleen, pancreatic beta-cells and kidney, whereas UCP3 is found in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Homologs of UCP2 and UCP3 are found in marsupials, birds, fish and plants. Despite a low level of sequence homology with UCP1-3, UCP4 and UCP5 share their functional properties (Hoang et al. 2012).There is strong evidence that the regulated uncoupling caused by these proteins attenuates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, protects against cellular damage, and (in beta-cells) diminishes insulin secretion. There are also untested suggestions that their transport of fatty acids may be physiologically important (Brand & Esteves 2005, Esteves & Brand 2005, Krauss et al. 2005). The modest depolarization brought about by UCP activation is thought to diminish superoxide generation without significantly compromising ATP production, creating a protective, negative-feedback system that complements enzymatic defences against reactive oxygen species. There is some evidence that this mechanism is important in the etiology of Parkninson's Disease. Deletion of Park7 (DJ-1) decreased the abundance of Ucp5 and Ucp4 mRNA and compromised mitochondrial uncoupling in response to oxidant stress (Guzman et al. 2010). This may explain the unusual accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations with age in SNc dopaminergic neurons (Bender et al. 2006). These mutations, which are attributable to accumulated superoxide exposure, diminish mitochondrial competence and promote phenotypic decline, proteostatic impairments and death (Nicholls 2008).A number of models have been proposed for the molecular mechanism by which fatty acids lead to increased proton conductance by UCP1 in brown adipose tissue mitochondria, and presumably by the other UCPs as well. These are the ""fatty acid cycling"" model and the ""proton buffering"" model.Studies of mouse models and of cultured human cells have suggested that oleoyl-phenylalanine, synthesized by extracellular PM20D1, may play a role in uncoupling independent of the action of UCPs (Long et al. 2016).

Growth factors stimulate mTORC1 through the activation of the canonical insulin and Ras signaling pathways. The energy status of the cell is signaled to mTORC1 through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key sensor of intracellular energy status (Hardie 2007). Energy depletion (low ATP:ADP ratio) activates AMPK which phosphorylates TSC2, increasing its GAP activity towards Rheb which reduces mTORC1 activation (Inoki et al. 2003). AMPK can reduce mTORC1 activity by directly phosphorylating Raptor (Gwinn et al. 2008). Amino acids positively regulate mTORC1 (reviewed by Guertin & Sabatini 2007). In the presence of amino acids, Rag proteins bind Raptor to promote the relocalization of mTORC1 from the cytoplasm to lysosomal membranes (Puertollano 2014) where it is activated by Rheb (Saucedo et al. 2003, Stocker et al.?2003). Translocation of mTOR to the lysosome requires active Rag GTPases and a complex known as Ragulator, a pentameric protein complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to lysosomes (Sancak et al. 2008, 2010, Bar-Peled et al. 2012). Rag proteins function as heterodimers, consisting of GTP-bound RagA or RagB complexed with GDP-bound RagC or RagD. Amino acids may trigger the GTP loading of RagA/B, thereby promoting binding to raptor and assembly of an activated mTORC1 complex, though a recent study suggested that the activation of mTORC1 is not dependent on Rag GTP charging (Oshiro et al. 2014). The activity of Rheb is regulated by a complex consisting of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), TSC2, and TBC1 domain family member 7 (TBC1D7) (Huang et al. 2008, Dibble et al. 2012). This complex localizes to lysosomes and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that inhibits the activity of Rheb (Menon et al. 2014, Demetriades et al. 2014). In the presence of growth factors or insulin, TSC releases its inhibitory activity on Rheb, thus allowing the activation of mTORC1.",NA,

They are produced, and secreted in minute amounts, by a variety of tissues. They signal through two types of receptors: NTRK (TRK) tyrosine kinase receptors (TRKA, TRKB, TRKC), which differ in their preferred neurotrophin ligand, and p75NTR death receptor, which interacts with all neurotrophins. Besides the nervous system, TRK receptors and p75NTR are expressed in a variety of other tissues. For review, please refer to Bibel and Barde 2000, Poo 2001, Lu et al. 2005, Skaper 2012, Park and Poo 2013.NTRK receptors, NTRK1 (TRKA), NTRK2 (TRKB) and NTRK3 (TRKC) are receptor tyrosine kinases activated by ligand binding to their extracellular domain. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, followed by trans-autophosphorylation of dimerized receptors on conserved tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region. Phosphorylated tyrosinesÂ in the intracellular domain of the receptor serve as docking sites for adapter proteins, triggering downstream signaling cascades.NTRK1 (TRKA) is the receptor for the nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is primarily secreted by tissues that are innervated by sensory and sympathetic neurons. NTRK1 signaling promotes growth and survival of neurons during embryonic development and maintenance of neuronal cell integrity in adulthood (reviewed by Marlin and Li 2015).Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4, also known as NT-4) are two high affinity ligands for NTRK2 (TRKB). Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3, also known as NT-3) binds to NTRK2 with low affinity and may not be a physiologically relevant ligand. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a high affinity ligand for NTRK1, does not interact with NTRK2. NTRK2 signaling is implicated in neuronal development in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) and may play a role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning (reviewed by Minichiello 2009). NTRK2 may modify neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission by directly phosphorylating voltage gated channels (Rogalski et al. 2000).NTF3 (NT-3) is the ligand for NTRK3 (TRKC). Signaling downstream of activated NTRK3, regulates cell survival, proliferation and motility. In the absence of its ligand, NTRK3 functions as a dependence receptor and triggers BAX and CASP9-dependent cell death (Tauszig-Delamasure et al. 2007, Ichim et al. 2013).",NA,
Homo sapiens,R-HSA-166658,Complement cascade,Immune System,Reactome,"Version 81, 2022",12,"HMDB0000803, HMDB0000215, HMDB0000464, HMDB0002111","In the complement cascade, a panel of soluble molecules rapidly and effectively senses a danger or damage and triggers reactions to provide a response that discriminates among foreign intruders, cellular debris, healthy and altered host cells (Ricklin D et al. 2010). Complement proteins circulate in the blood stream in functionally inactive states. When triggered the complement cascade generates enzymatically active molecules (such as C3/C5 convertases) and biological effectors: opsonins (C3b, C3d and C4b), anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), and C5b, which initiates assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Three branches lead to complement activation: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways (Kang YH et al. 2009; Ricklin D et al. 2010). The classical pathway is initiated by C1 complex binding to immune complexes, pentraxins or other targets such as apoptotic cells leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 components and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The lectin pathwayÂ is activated by binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) to repetitive carbohydrate residues, or by binding of ficolins to carbohydrate or acetylated groups on target surfaces. MBL and ficolins interact with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the internal thioester group of C3 to give C3(H2O). Alternative pathway activation involves interaction of C3(H2O) and/or previously generated C3b with factor B, which is cleaved by factor D to generate the alternative C3 convertases C3(H2O)Bb and/or C3bBb. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form opsonin C3b and anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b covalently binds to glycoproteins scattered across the target cell surface. This is followed by an amplification reaction that generates additional C3 convertases and deposits more C3b at the local site. C3b can also bind to C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases, which mediate C5 cleavage leading to MAC formation. Thus, the activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes: opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (MAC) assembly on the cell surface, production of anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a involved in the host inflammatory response, C5a-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis, and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is able to distinguish between pathological and physiological challenges, i.e. the outcomes of complement activation are predetermined by the trigger and are tightly tuned by a combination of initiation events with several regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms use soluble (e.g., C4BP, CFI and CFH) and membrane-bound regulators (e.g., CR1, CD46(MCP), CD55(DAF) and CD59) and are coordinated by complement receptors such as CR1, CR2, etc. In response to microbial infection complement activation results in flagging microorganisms with opsonins for facilitated phagocytosis, formation of MAC on cells such as Gram-negative bacteria leading to cell lysis, and release of C3a and C5a to stimulate downstream immune responses and to attract leukocytes. Most pathogens can be eliminated by these complement-mediated host responses, though some pathogenic microorganisms have developed ways of avoiding complement recognition or blocking host complement attack resulting in greater virulence (Lambris JD et al. 2008; Serruto D et al. 2010). All three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) have been implicated in clearance of dying cells (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001; Gullstrand B et al.2009; Kemper C et al. 2008). Altered surfaces of apoptotic cells are recognized by complement proteins leading to opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. In contrast to pathogens, apoptotic cells are believed to induce only a limited complement activation by allowing opsonization of altered surfaces but restricting the terminal pathway of MAC formation (Gershov D et al. 2000; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M 2011). Thus, opsonization facilitates clearance of dying cells and cell debris without triggering danger signals and further inflammatory responses (Fraser DA et al. 2007, 2009; Benoit ME et al. 2012). C1q-mediated complement activation by apoptotic cells has been shown in a variety of human cells: keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells (Korb LC and Ahearn JM 1997; Mold C and Morris CA 2001; Navratil JS et al. 2001; Nauta AJ et al. 2004). In addition to C1q the opsonization of apoptotic Jurkat T cells with MBL also facilitated clearance of these cells by both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Nauta AJ et al. 2004). Also C3b, iC3b and C4b deposition on apoptotic cells as a consequence of activation of the complement cascade may promote complement-mediated phagocytosis. C1q, MBL and cleavage fragments of C3/C4 can bind to several receptors expressed on macrophages (e.g. cC1qR (calreticulin), CR1, CR3, CR4) suggesting a potential clearance mechanism through this interaction (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001). Apoptosis is also associated with an altered expression of complement regulators on the surface of apoptotic cells. CD46 (MCP) bound to the plasma membrane of a healthy cell protects it from complement-mediated attack by preventing deposition of C3b and C4b, and reduced expression of CD46 on dying cells may lead to enhanced opsonization (Elward K et al. 2005). Upregulation of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 on apoptotic cell surfaces may protect damaged cells against complement mediated lysis (Pedersen ED et al. 2007; Iborra A et al. 2003; Hensel F et al. 2001). In addition, fluid-phase complement regulators such as C4BP, CFH may also inhibit lysis of apoptotic cells by limiting complement activation (Trouw LA et al 2007; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M. 2011). Complement facilitates the clearance of immune complexes (IC) from the circulation (Chevalier J and Kazatchkine MD 1989; Nielsen CH et al. 1997). Erythrocytes bear clusters of complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35), which serves as an immune adherence receptor for C3 and/or C4 fragments deposited on IC that are shuttled to liver and spleen, where IC are transferred and processed by tissue macrophages through an Fc receptor-mediated process. Complement proteins are always present in the blood and a small percentage spontaneously activate. Inappropriate activation leads to host cell damage, so on healthy human cells any complement activation or amplification is strictly regulated by surface-bound regulators that accelerate decay of the convertases (CR1, CD55), act as a cofactor for the factor I (CFI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or prevent the formation of MAC (CD59). Soluble regulators such as C4BP, CFH and FHL1 recognize self surface pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation. Complement components interact with other biological systems. Upon microbial infection complement acts in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to amplify innate host defense. Anaphylatoxin C5a binds C5a receptor (C5aR) resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the TLR and C5aR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response to infection. This interplay is negatively modulated by co-ligation of TLR and the second C5a receptor, C5L2, suggesting the existence of complex immunomodulatory interactions (Kohl J 2006; Hajishengallis G and Lambris JD 2010). In addition to C5aR and C5L2, complement receptor 3 (CR3) facilitates TLR2 or TLR4 signaling pathways by promoting a recruitment of their sorting adaptor TIRAP (MAL) to the receptor complex (van Bruggen R et al. 2007; Kagan JC and Medzhitov R 2006). Complement may activate platelets or facilitate biochemical and morphological changes in the endothelium potentiating coagulation and contributing to homeostasis in response to injury (Oikonomopoulou K et al. 2012). The interplay of complement and coagulation also involves cleavage of C3 and C5 convertases by coagulation proteases, generating biologically active anaphylatoxins (Amara U et al. 2010). Complement is believed to link the innate response to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Toapanta FR and Ross TM 2006; Mongini PK et al. 1997). The majority of published data is based on experiments using mouse as a model organism. Further characterization of the influence of complement on B or T cell activation is required for the human system, since differences between murine models and the human system are not yet fully determined. Complement is also involved in regulation of mobilization and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to the circulation and peripheral tissue in order to accommodate blood cell replenishment (Reca R et al. 2006). Thus, the complement system orchestrates the host defense by sensing a danger signal and transmitting it into specific cellular responses while extensively communicating with associated biological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. Originally the larger fragment of Complement Factor 2 (C2) was designated C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. Recent literature may use the updated nomenclature and refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and refer to the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway Reactome adheres to the original convention to agree with the current (Sep 2013) Uniprot names for C2 fragments. The complement cascade pathway is organised into the following sections: initial triggering, activation of C3 and C5, terminal pathway and regulation.Â ",NA,

All are Ca-dependent (C-type) lectins that initiate the complement cascade after binding to specific carbohydrate patterns on the target cell surface. All form trimers and larger oligomers (Jensen et al. 2005, Dommett et al. 2006, Garlatti et al. 2010). MBL and ficolins circulate in plasma as complexes with homodimers of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) (Fujita et al. 2004, Hajela et al. 2002). MASP1, MASP2 and MASP3 have all been reported to mediate complement activation. Upon binding of human lectin to the target surface, the complex of lectin:MASP undergoes conformational changes that result in MASP cleavage and activation (Matsushita M et al. 2000, Fujita et al. 2004). Active MASP2 cleaves C4 to generate C4a and C4b. C4b binds to the target cell surface?via its thioester bond, then binds circulating C2 (Law and Dodds 1997). Bound C2 is cleaved by MASP2 to yield the C3 convertase C4b:C2a. The active form of MASP1 was reported to cleave C2 in a manner similar to MASP2 (Matsushita et al. 2000, Chen & Wallis 2004). MASP1 can cleave proenzyme MASP2, leading to complement activation (Heja et al. 2012). MASP1 can also cleave fibrinogen to yield fibrinopeptide B, and activates factor XIII. MASP1 may have a role in removal of 'dead C3', i.e. C3(H2O) (Hajela et al. 2002). In addition to MASP1 to 3, two alternatively-slpiced forms of MASP1 (MAp44) and MASP2 (sMAP) have been implicated in complement cascade signaling (Takahashi et al. 1999, Degn et al. 2010).

This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens, a single IgM can initiate the pathway while multiple IgGs are needed, or when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Binding leads to conformational changes in C1q, activating the serine protease activity of C1r, which then cleaves C1s, another serine protease. The C1r:C1s component is now capable of splitting C4 and C2 to produce the classical C3-convertase C4b2a. C1r and C1s are additionally controlled by C1-inhibitor.(Kerr MA 1980)The lectin pathway is similar in operation but has different components. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins (L-ficolin, M-ficolin and H-ficolin) initiate the lectin pathway cascade by binding to specific carbohydrate patterns on pathogenic cell?surfaces. MBL and ficolins circulate in plasma in complexes with homodimers of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) (Fujita et al. 2004; Hajela et al. 2002). Upon binding of human lectin (MBL or ficolins) to the target surface the complex of lectin:MASP undergoes conformational changes, which results in the activation of MASPs by cleavage (Matsushita M et al. 2000; Fujita et al. 2004).

The long terminal repeats (LTR) located at either end of the proviral DNA contain regulatory sequences that recruit cellular transcription factors. The U3 region of the 5' LTR contains numerous cis-acting elements that regulate Pol II-mediated transcription initiation. The full-length transcript, which encodes nine genes, functions as an mRNA and is packaged as genomic RNA. Smaller (subgenomic) viral mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing. The activities of Tat and Rev create two phases of gene expression (see Karn 1999; Cullen 1991). The Tat protein is an RNA specific trans-activator of LTR-mediated transcription. Association of Tat with TAR, a RNA stem-loop within the RNA leader sequence, is required for efficient elongation of the HIV-1 transcript. In the early phase of viral transcription, a multiply-spliced?set of mRNAs is generated, producing the transcripts of the regulatory proteins, Tat, Rev, and Nef. In the late phase, Rev regulates nuclear export of HIV-1 mRNAs, repressing expression of the early regulatory mRNAs and promoting expression of viral structural proteins.

Tat appears to be required in order to overcome the arrest of RNA Pol II by the negative transcriptional elongation factors DSIF and NELF (Wada et al. 1998; Yamaguchi et al. 1999; Yamaguchi et al 2002; Fujinaga et al. 2004). While Pol II can associate with the proviral LTR and initiate transcription in the absence of Tat, these polymerase complexes are non-processive and dissociate from the template prematurely producing very short transcripts (Kao et al. 1987). Tat associates with the RNA element, TAR, which forms a stem loop structure in the leader RNA sequence (Dingwall et al. 1989). Tat also associates with the cellular kinase complex P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) and recruits it to the TAR stem loop structure (Herrmann, 1995) (Wei et al. 1998). This association between?Tat, TAR and P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) is believed to bring the catalytic subunit of this kinase complex (Cdk9) in close proximity to Pol II where it hyperphosphorylates the CTD of RNA Pol II (Zhou et al. 2000). The RD subunits of NELF and the SPT5 subunit of DSIF, which associate through RD with the bottom stem of TAR, are also phosphorylated by P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) (Yamaguchi et al. 2002; Fujinaga et al. 2004; Ivanov et al. 2000). Phosphorylation of RD results in its dissociation from TAR. Thus, Tat appears to facilitate transcriptional elongation of the HIV-1 transcript by hyperphosphorylating the RNA Poll II CTD and by removing the negative transcription elongation factors from TAR.

Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 are endosomal receptors that sense ssRNA oligonucleotides containing guanosine (G)- and uridine (U)-rich sequences from RNA viruses (Jurk M et al. 2002; Heil F et al. 2004; Diebold SS et al. 2004; Li Y et al. 2013; reviewed in Lester SN & Li K 2014). TLR7 is primarily expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and, to some extent, in B cells, monocytes and macrophages, whereas TLR8 is mostly expressed in monocytes, macrophages and myeloid DCs. Upon engagement of ssRNAs in endosomes, TLR7/8 initiate the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway, culminating in synthesis of type I and type III IFNs and proinflammatory mediators via activation of IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and NF-¦ÊB, respectively, depending on the cell type (reviewed in Lester SN & Li K 2014). TLR7 and TLR8 are able to detect GU-rich ssRNA sequences from?the viral genomes of influenza, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), coxsackie B virus, coronavirus and flaviviruses (hepatitis C virus, HCV and West Nile virus, WNV; reviewed in Lester SN & Li K 2014). Specifically, GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotides derived from HIV-1, for example, stimulate dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages to secrete interferon-alpha and proinflammatory, as well as regulatory, cytokines (Heil F et al. 2004). This has been found to be mediated by TLR7, as well as TLR8. Similarly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus type 1 (SARS-CoV-1) GU-rich ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities in mononuclear phagocytes to induce considerable level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 release via the TLR7 and TLR8 (Li Y et al. 2013). Further, mice deficient in either Tlr7 or the TLR adaptor protein Myd88 demonstrated reduced responses to in vivo infection with VSV (Lund JM et al. 2004), mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-1 (Sheahan et al. 2008; Totura et al., 2015). Upon Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, lack of MyD88 signaling resulted in delayed viral clearance and increased lung pathology in mice (Zhao et al. 2014). Consistently, another study showed that Tlr7-/- mice have reduced IFN expression compared with wild-type mice (Channappanavar et al. 2019). In addition, loss of function TLR7 variants identified in the patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) resulted in defective upregulation of type I IFN¨Crelated genes in the TLR7 pathway (Figure 3) in response to the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with controls (Van der Made CI et al. 2020). Separate studies showed that synthetic imidazoquinoline compounds (e.g. imiquimod and R-848, low-molecular-weight immune response modifiers that can induce the synthesis of interferon-alpha) also exert their effects in a MyD88-dependent fashion through TLR7 or TLR8 (Hemmi H et al. 2002; Jurk M et al. 2002; Diebold SS et al. 2004). Some viruses utilize multiple strategies to evade antiviral innate immune signaling, as is seen with influenza or SARS coronaviruses. TLR7-mediated innate immunity, for example, was associated with the negative regulation through removing Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF3/TRAF6 by papin-like protease (PLpro) catalytic domain of nsp3 from SARS-CoV-1 (Li SW et al. 2016). Thus, TLR7 and TLR8 play a critical role in sensing of viral ssRNA in the endosome.",NA,

NOD1 and NOD2 activation induces transcription of immune response genes, predominantly mediated by the proinflammatory transcriptional factor NFkappaB but also by AP-1 and Elk-1 (Inohara et al. 2005). NFkappaB translocates to the nucleus following release from IkappaB proteins. NOD1 and NOD2 signaling involves an interaction between their caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and the CARD of the kinase RIPK2 (RIP2/RICK). This leads to the activation of the NFkappaB pathway and MAPK pathways (Windheim et al. 2007).Activated NODs oligomerize via their NACHT domains, inducing physical proximity of RIP2 proteins that is believed to trigger their K63-linked polyubiquitination, facilitating recruitment of the TAK1 complex. RIP2 also recruits NEMO, bringing the TAK1 and IKK complexes into proximity, leading to NF-kappaB activation and activation?of MAPK signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated that K63-linked regulatory ubiquitination of RIP2 is essential for the recruitment of TAK1 (Hasegawa et al. 2008, Hitosumatsu et al. 2008). As observed for toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, ubiquitination can be removed by the deubiquitinating enzyme A20, thereby dampening NOD1/NOD2-induced NF-kappaB activation. NOD1 and NOD2 both induce K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP2, but NOD2-signaling appears to preferentially utilize the E3 ligase TRAF6, while TRAF2 and TRAF5 were shown to be important for NOD1-mediated signaling.

The receptors involved recognize conserved molecules present in microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and/or molecules that are produced as a result of tissue injury, the damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). PAMPs are essential to the pathogen and therefore unlikely to vary. Examples are lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans (PGNs) and viral RNA. DAMPs include intracellular proteins, such as heat-shock proteins and extracellular matrix proteins released by tissue injury, such as hyaluronan fragments. Non-protein DAMPs include ATP, uric acid, heparin sulfate and dsDNA. The receptors for these factors are referred to collectively as pathogen- or pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The best studied of these are the membrane-associated?Toll-like receptor family. Less well studied but more numerous are the intracellular nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs) also called nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, a family with over 20 members in humans and over 30 in mice. These recognise PAMPs/DAMPs from phagocytosed microorganisms or from intracellular infections (Kobayashi et al. 2003, Proell et al. 2008, Wilmanski et al. 2008). Some NLRs are involved in process unrelated to pathogen detection such as tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, graft-versus-host disease and early development (Kufer & Sansonetti 2011). Structurally NLRs can be subdivided into the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing NLRCs (NODs) and the pyrin domain (PYD)-containing NLRPs (NALPs), plus outliers including ice protease (caspase-1) activating factor (IPAF) (Martinon & Tschopp, 2005). In practical terms, NLRs can be divided into the relatively well characterized NOD1/2 which signal via RIP2 primarily to NFkappaB, and the remainder, some of which participate in macromolecular structures called Inflammasomes that activate caspases. Mutations in several members of the NLR protein family have been linked to inflammatory diseases, suggesting these molecules play important roles in maintaining host-pathogen interactions and inflammatory responses.Most NLRs have a tripartite structure consisting of a variable amino-terminal domain, a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD or NACHT) that is believed to mediate the formation of self oligomers, and a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) that detects PAMPs/DAMPs. In most cases the amino-terminal domain includes protein-interaction modules, such as CARD or PYD, some harbour baculovirus inhibitor repeat (BIR) or other domains. For most characterised NLRs these domains have been attributed to downstream signalingUnder resting conditions, NLRs are thought to be present in an autorepressed form, with the LRR folded back onto the NACHT domain preventing oligomerization. Accessory proteins may help maintain the inactive state. PAMP/DAMP exposure is thought to triggers conformational changes that expose the NACHT domain enabling oligomerization and recruitment of effectors, though it should be noted that due to the lack of availability of structural data, the mechanistic details of NLR activation remain largely elusive.New terminology for NOD-like receptors was adopted by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) in 2008 to standardize the nomenclature of NLRs. The acronym NLR, once standing for NOD-like receptor, now is an abbreviation of 'nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing' protein. The term NOD-like receptor is officially outdated and replaced by NLRC where the C refers to the CARD domain. However the official gene symbols for NOD1 and NOD2 still contain NOD and this general term is still widely used.",NA,

They are remarkably efficient so that very small doses cause paralysis of an affected person (Lalli et al. 2003; Turton et al. 2002). All characterized clostridial neurotoxins are synthesized as products of chromosomal, plasmid or prophage-borne bacterial genes. The nascent toxin may be cleaved into light (LC) and heavy (HC) chain moieties that remain attached by noncovalent interactions and a disulfide bond (Turton et al. 2002).Strains of Clostridium botulinum produce seven serologically distinct toxins, BoNT/A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. An eighth toxin, BoNT/H has recently been identified (Barash & Arnon 2014) but its molecular properties have not yet been described. Human poisoning most commonly result from ingestion of toxin contaminated food. More rarely, it is due to wound infection or clostridial colonization?of the gut of an infant whose own gut flora have not yet developed or of an older individual whose flora have been suppressed. While all seven characterized toxins can cleave human target proteins, three, BoNT/A, B, and E, are most commonly associated with human disease (Hatheway 1995; Sakaguchi 1982). BoNT/F is also able to cause human botulism.Once ingested, the botulinum toxin must be taken up from the gut lumen into the circulation, a process mediated by four accessory proteins. These proteins form a complex that mediates transcytosis of the toxin molecule across the gut epithelium, allowing its entry into the circulation. The accessory proteins produced by different C. botulinum strains differ in their affinities for polarized epithelia of different species (e.g., human versus canine), and may thus be a key factor in human susceptibility to the toxins of strains A, B, and E and resistance to the others (Simpson 2004).Clostridium tetani produces TeNT toxin. Human poisoning is the result of toxin secretion by bacteria growing in an infected wound and the toxin is released directly into the circulation.Circulating clostridial toxins are taken up by neurons at neuromuscular junctions. They bind to specific gangliosides (BoNT/C, TeNT) or to both gangliosides and synaptic vesicle proteins (BoNT/A, B, D G) exposed on the neuronal plasma membrane during vesicle exocytosis (Montal 2010). All seven characterized forms of BoNT are thought to be taken up into synaptic vesicles as these re-form at the neuromuscular junction. These vesicles remain close to the site of uptake and are rapidly re-loaded with neurotransmitter and acidified (Sudhoff 2004). TeNT, in contrast, is taken up into clathrin coated vesicles that reach the neuron cell body by retrograde transport and then possibly other neurons before undergoing acidification. Vesicle acidification causes a conformational change in the toxin, allowing its HC part to function as a channel through which its LC part is extruded into the neuronal cytosol. The HC - LC disulfide bond is cleaved and the cytosolic LC functions as a zinc metalloprotease to cleave specific bonds in proteins on the cytosolic faces of synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes that normally mediate exocytosis (Lalli et al. 2003; Montal 2010).",NA,

The general signaling scheme is rather simple: upon binding of a ligand, an activated plasma membrane receptor complex is formed, which passes on the signal towards the nucleus through a phosphorylated receptor SMAD (R-SMAD). In the nucleus, the activated R-SMAD promotes transcription in complex with a closely related helper molecule termed Co-SMAD (SMAD4). However, this simple linear pathway expands into a network when various regulatory components and mechanisms are taken into account. The signaling pathway includes a great variety of different TGF-beta/BMP superfamily ligands and receptors, several types of the R-SMADs, and functionally critical negative feedback loops. The R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex can interact with a great number of transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors to regulate positively or negatively effector genes, so that theÂ interpretation of a signal depends on the cell-type and cross talk with other signaling pathways such as Notch, MAPK and Wnt. The pathway plays a number of different biological roles in the control of embryonic and adult cell proliferation and differentiation, and it is implicated in a great number of human diseases.TGF beta (TGFB1) is secreted as a homodimer, and as such it binds to TGF beta receptor II (TGFBR2), inducing its dimerization. Binding of TGF beta enables TGFBR2 to form a stable hetero-tetrameric complex with TGF beta receptor I homodimer (TGFBR1). TGFBR2 acts as a serine/threonine kinase and phosphorylates serine and threonine residues within the short GS domain (glycine-serine rich domain) of TGFBR1.The phosphorylated heterotetrameric TGF beta receptor complex (TGFBR) internalizes into clathrin coated endocytic vesicles where it associates with the endosomal membrane protein SARA. SARA facilitates the recruitment of cytosolic SMAD2 and SMAD3, which act as R-SMADs for TGF beta receptor complex. TGFBR1 phosphorylates recruited SMAD2 and SMAD3, inducing a conformational change that promotes formation of R-SMAD trimers and dissociation of R-SMADs from the TGF beta receptor complex. In the cytosol, phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 associate with SMAD4 (known as Co-SMAD), forming a heterotrimer which is more stable than the R-SMAD homotrimers. R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer translocates to the nucleus where it directly binds DNA and, in cooperation with other transcription factors, regulates expression of genes involved in cell differentiation, in a context-dependent manner. The intracellular level of SMAD2 and SMAD3 is regulated by SMURF ubiquitin ligases, which target R-SMADs for degradation. In addition, nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer stimulates transcription of inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs), forming a negative feedback loop. I-SMADs bind the phosphorylated TGF beta receptor complexes on caveolin coated vesicles, derived from the lipid rafts, and recruit SMURF ubiquitin ligases to TGF beta receptors, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of TGFBR1. Nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimers are targets of nuclear ubiquitin ligases which ubiquitinate SMAD2/3 and SMAD4, causing heterotrimer dissociation, translocation of ubiquitinated SMADs to the cytosol and their proteasome-mediated degradation.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex minimally composed of a conserved protein subunit containing a reverse transcriptase domain (human telomerase reverse transcriptase, hTERT) and a template-containing RNA (human telomerase RNA component, hTERC, or hTR, hTER). The primer for telomerase is the G-rich single-strand overhang at the chromosome end. Telomerase can perform multiple rounds of repeat synthesis. The reaction cycle has been inferred from in vitro studies of telomerase from multiple organisms and can be described as having four events: 1) DNA primer recognition, 2) RNA template alignment, 3) elongation, and 4) translocation. Telomeric DNA is recognized in part by a presumed ""anchor site"" in hTERT, which preferentially binds G-rich DNA, and this interaction can affect elongation and translocation steps. This interaction occurs 5' of the alignment?of the RNA template with the end nucleotides of the chromosome. RNA alignment positions the template adjacent to the chromosome terminus. During elongation, the template directs sequential addition of nucleotides to the telomere end. After synthesis of a repeat is completed, relative movement of telomerase and the primer, termed translocation, repositions telomerase at the end of the newly added sequence to allow initiation of another round of repeat addition.",NA,

This complex is also active in interphase insuring the appropriate length of the G1 phase (reviewed in Peters, 2002). The APC/C contains at least 12 subunits and functions as an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) promoting the multiubiquitination of its target proteins (see Gieffers et al., 2001). In the ubiquitination reaction, ubiquitin is activated by the formation of a thioester bond with the (E1) ubiquitin activating enzyme then transferred to a cysteine residue within the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) and ultimately to a lysine residue within the target protein, with the aid of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the APC/C. The ubiquitin chains generated are believed to target proteins for destruction by the 26S proteasome (Reviewed in Peters, 1994 ) The activity of the APC/C is highly periodic?during the cell cycle and is controlled by a combination of regulatory events. The APC/C is activated by phosphorylation and the regulated recruitment of activating subunits and is negatively regulated by sequestration by kinetochore-associated checkpoint proteins. The Emi1 protein associates with Cdh1 and Cdc20, inhibiting the APC/C between G1/S and prophase. RSSA1 may play a similar role in ihibiting the APC during early mitosis.Following phosphorylation of the APC/C core subunits by mitotic kinases, the activating subunit, Cdc20 is recruited to the APC/C and is responsible for mitotic activities, including the initiation of sister chromatid separation and the timing of exit from mitosis (See Zachariae and Nasmyth, 1999). Substrates of the Cdc20:APC/C complex, which are recognized by a motif known as the destruction box (D box) include Cyclin A, Nek2, Securin and Cyclin B. Degradation of Securin and Cyclin B does not occur until the mitotic spindle checkpoint has been satisfied (see Castro et al. 2005).Cdc20 is degraded late in mitosis (Reviewed in Owens and Hoyt, 2005). At this time the activating subunit, Cdh1, previously maintained in an inactive phosphorylated state by mitotic kinases, is dephosphorylated and associates with and activates the APC/C. The APC/C:Cdh1 complex recognizes substrates containing a D box, a KEN box (Pfleger and Kirschner, 2000) or a D box activated (DAD) domain (Castro et al., 2002) sequence and promotes the ordered degration of mitotic cyclins and other mitotic proteins culminating with its own ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) subunit UbcH10 (Rape et al., 2006). This ordered degradation promotes the stability of Cyclin A at the end of G1. This stabilization, in turn, promotes the phosphorylation of Cdh1 and its abrupt dissociation from the APC/C, allowing accumulation of cyclins for the next G1/S transition",NA,

To guard against such instability, genotoxically-stressed cells activate checkpoint factors that halt or slow cell cycle progression. Among the pathways affected are DNA replication by reduction of replication origin firing, and mitosis by inhibiting activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). A key factor involved in the response to stalled replication forks is the ATM- and rad3-related (ATR) kinase, a member of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family. Rather than responding to particular lesions in DNA, ATR and its binding partner ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) sense replication fork stalling indirectly by associating with persistent ssDNA bound by RPA. These structures would be formed, for example, by dissociation of the replicative helicase from the leading or lagging strand DNA polymerase when the polymerase encounters a DNA lesion that blocks DNA synthesis. AlongÂ with phosphorylating the downstream transducer kinase Chk1 and the tumor suppressor p53, activated ATR modifies numerous factors that regulate cell cycle progression or the repair of DNA damage. The persistent ssDNA also stimulates recruitment of the RFC-like Rad17-Rfc2-5 alternative clamp-loading complex, which subsequently loads the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex onto the DNA. The latter '9-1-1' complex serves to facilitate Chk1 binding to the stalled replication fork, where Chk1 is phosphorylated by ATR and thereby activated. Upon activation, Chk1 can phosphorylate additional substrates including the Cdc25 family of phosphatases (Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C). These enzymes catalyze the removal of inhibitory phosphate residues from cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), allowing their activation. In particular, Cdc25A primarily functions at the G1/S transition to dephosphorylate Cdk2 at Thr 14 and Tyr 15, thus positively regulating the Cdk2-cyclin E complex for S-phase entry. Cdc25A also has mitotic functions. Phosphorylation of Cdc25A at Ser125 by Chk1 leads to Cdc25A ubiquitination and degradation, thus inhibiting DNA replication origin firing. In contrast, Cdc25B and Cdc25C regulate the onset of mitosis through dephosphorylation and activation of Cdk1-cyclin B complexes. In response to replication stress, Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25B and Cdc25C leading to Cdc25B/C complex formation with 14-3-3 proteins. As these complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm, they are unable to activate the nuclear Cdk1-cyclin B complex for mitotic entry.These events are outlined in the figure. Persistent single-stranded DNA associated with RPA binds claspin (A) and ATR:ATRIP (B), leading to claspin phosphorylation (C). In parallel, the same single-stranded DNA:RPA complex binds RAD17:RFC (D), enabling the loading of RAD9:HUS1:RAD1 (9-1-1) complex onto the DNA (E).

Binding of EGFR to its ligands induces conformational change that unmasks the dimerization interface in the extracellular domain of EGFR, leading to receptor homo- or heterodimerization at the cell surface. Dimerization of the extracellular regions of EGFR triggers additional conformational change of the cytoplasmic EGFR regions, enabling the kinase domains of two EGFR molecules to achieve the catalytically active conformation. Ligand activated EGFR dimers trans-autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of intracellular substrates, which then stimulate intracellular signal transduction cascades that are involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Recruitment of complexes containing?GRB2 and SOS1 to phosphorylated EGFR dimers either directly, through phosphotyrosine residues that serve as GRB2 docking sites, or indirectly, through SHC1 recruitment, promotes GDP to GTP exchange on RAS, resulting in the activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade.

A great deal is known about the function of cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and at ganglionic synapses, the actions of ACh in the central nervous system are not as well understood. Acetylcholine is synthesized in nerve terminals from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) synthesized from glucose) and choline. This reaction is catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The presence of acetyltransferase in a neuron is thus a strong indication that ACh is used as one of its transmitters. Choline is present in plasma at a concentration of about 10 mM, and is taken up into cholinergic neurons by a high affinity Na+/choline transporter. About 10,000 molecules of ACh are packaged into each neurotransmitter containing vesicle by a vesicular ACh transporter. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) are ionotropic receptors that can be activated by nicotine and permeable to of monovalent (sodium, potassium) and divalent cations(calcium), however, the permeability of sodium and/or calcium maybe high or low depending on the subunit composition of the receptor. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are expressed widely in the central and peripheral nervous system in the presynaptic terminal, terminal bouton and post synaptic neuron. Functionally nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the pre synaptic and postsynaptic terminals behave similarly. Nicotinic AChR are a family of acetylcholine gated pentameric receptors that are formed by the association of various combinations of mostly alpha, beta subunits (for the neuronal type) and together with gamma, delta and epsilon subunits (for the muscle type). In addition, receptors may be more diverse due the fact that some receptors have same subunits but the stoichiometry of the subunits is different.",NA,

One of the best understood RTKs is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Growth factors can bind to EGFR and activate it to initiate signalling cascades within the cell. EGFRs can also be recruited to clathrin-coated pits which can be internalised into endocytic vesicles. From here, EGFRs can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or directed to lysosomes for destruction.This provides a mechanism by which EGFR signalling is negatively regulated and controls the strength and duration of EGFR-induced signals. It also prevents EGFR hyperactivation as commonly seen in tumorigenesis.The proto-oncogene Cbl can negatively regulate EGFR signalling. The Cbl family of RING-type ubiquitin ligases are able to poly-ubiquitinate EGFR, an essential step in EGFR degradation. All Cbl proteins have a unique domain that recognises phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated EGFRs.?They also direct the ubiquitination and degradation of activated EGFRs by recruiting ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes. Cbl proteins function by specifically targeting activated EGFRs and mediating their down-regulation, thus providing a means by which signaling processes can be negatively regulated.Cbl also promotes receptor internalization via it's interaction with an adaptor protein, CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85kDa). CIN85 binds to Cbl via it's SH3 domain and is enhanced by the EGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. The proline-rich region of CIN85 interacts with endophilins which are regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Endophilins bind to membranes and induce membrane curvature, in conjunction with other proteins involved in CCV formation. The rapid recruitment of endophilin to the activated receptor complex by CIN85 is the mechanism which controls receptor internalization.",NA,

Indeed, select pathogen-derived DNA or RNA were shown to activate STING in human and mouse cells (Ishikawa H and Barber GN 2008; Ishikawa H et al. 2009; Sun W et al. 2009; Prantner D et al. 2010). Importantly, in vitro studies have shown that STING is essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Manzanillo PS et al. 2012), Plasmodium falciparum (Sharma S et al. 2011) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induced type I IFN production [Yan N et al 2010]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, plasmodium falciparum and HIV are three deadliest pathogens, which kill millions of people each year worldwide.STING has been also implicated in type I IFN response which was stimulated by fusion of viral and target-cell membrane in a manner independent of DNA, RNA and viral capsid [Holm CK et al 2012].Under steady stateÂ conditions, STING is positioned at the translocon complex within the ER membrane. However upon stimulation with intracellular DNA it translocates from ER to perinuclear vesicles via the Golgi by mechanisms that remain unclear (Ishikawa H and Barber GN 2008; Sun W et al. 2009; Ishikawa H et al. 2009; Saitoh T et al. 2009). Mouse Sting trafficking in dsDNA-stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells was found to depend on autophagy-related gene 9a (Atg9a) (Saitoh T et al. 2009).STING was reported to function as a signaling adaptor or coreceptor in response to cytosolic dsDNA (Unterholzner L et al. 2010; Zhang Z et al. 2011). STING was also shown to function as a direct DNA sensor to induce the innate immune response in human telomerase fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Abe T et al. 2013). Additionally, STING is thought to function as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. STING was shown to interact directly with c-di-GMP in human embryonic kidney HEK293T cell lysates (Burdette DL et al. 2011). Once STING is stimulated, its C-terminus serves as a signaling scaffold to recruit IRF3 and TBK1, which leads to TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 (Tanaka Y and Chen ZJ 2012).Mouse, but not human STING, can also bind vascular disrupting agents 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) and the antiviral small molecule 10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) to induce type I IFN production, suggesting a species-specific drug effect on the STING-mediated host response (Conlon J et al. 2013; Cavlar T et al. 2013).",NA,

Typical symptoms upon diagnosis include eosinophilia and associated T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma; the disease rapidly advances to acute leukemia, usually of myeloid lineage. At present the only effective treatment is allogenic stem cell transplantation (reviewed in Jackson, 2010). At the molecular level, EMS appears to be caused by translocation events on chromosome 8 that create gene fusions between the intracellular domain of FGFR1 and an N-terminal partner gene that encodes a dimerization domain. The resulting fusion protein dimerizes in a ligand-independent fashion based the N-terminal domain provided by the partner protein and stimulates constititutive downstream FGFR1 signaling without altering the intrisic kinase activity of the receptor. To date, 11 partner genes have been identified: ZMYM2, FGFR1OP, FGFR1OP2, HERVK, TRIM24, CUX1,?BCR, CEP110, LRRFIP1, MYO18A and CPSF6, although not all have been functionally characterized (reviewed in Jackson, 2010, Turner and Grose, 2010; Wesche, 2011).

Signaling appears to occur predominantly through PLCgamma, PI3K and STAT signaling, with a more minor contribution from MAPK activation.

SLC2 (encoding GLUTs) and SLC5 (encoding SGLTs) families mediate glucose absorption in the small intestine, glucose reabsorption in the kidney, glucose uptake by the brain across the blood-brain barrier and glucose release by all cells in the body. Glucose is taken up from interstitial fluid by a passive, facilitative transport driven by the diffusion gradient of glucose (and other sugars) across the plasma membrane. This process is mediated by a family of Na+-independent, facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) encoded by the SLC2A gene family (Zhao & Keating 2007; Wood & Trayhurn 2003). There are 14 members belonging to this family (GLUT1-12, 14 and HMIT (H+/myo-inositol symporter)). The GLUT family can be subdivided into three subclasses (I-III) based on sequence similarity and characteristic sequence motifs (Joost & Thorens 2001).Hexoses, notably fructose, glucose, and galactose, generated in the lumen of the small?intestine by breakdown of dietary carbohydrate are taken up by enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine and released from them into the blood. Uptake into enterocytes is mediated by two transporters localized on the lumenal surfaces of the cells, SGLT1 (glucose and galactose, together with sodium ions) and GLUT5 (fructose). GLUT2, localized on the basolateral surfaces of enterocytes, mediates the release of these hexoses into the blood (Wright et al. 2004). GLUT2 may also play a role in hexose uptake from the gut lumen into enterocytes when the lumenal content of monosaccharides is very high (Kellet & Brot-Laroche 2005) and GLUT5 mediates fructose uptake from the blood into cells of the body, notably hepatocytes.Cells take up glucose by facilitated diffusion, via glucose transporters (GLUTs) associated with the plasma membrane, a reversible reaction. Four tissue-specific GLUT isoforms are known. Glucose in the cytosol is phosphorylated by tissue-specific kinases to yield glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot cross the plasma membrane because of its negative charge. In the liver, this reaction is catalyzed by glucokinase which has a low affinity for glucose (Km about 10 mM) but is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. In other tissues, this reaction is catalyzed by isoforms of hexokinase. Hexokinases are feedback-inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate and have a high affinity for glucose (Km about 0.1 mM). Liver cells can thus accumulate large amounts of glucose 6-phosphate but only when blood glucose concentrations are high, while most other tissues can take up glucose even when blood glucose concentrations are low but cannot accumulate much intracellular glucose 6-phosphate. These differences are consistent with the view that that the liver functions to buffer blood glucose concentrations, while most other tissues take up glucose to meet immediate metabolic needs.Glucose 6-phosphatase, expressed in liver and kidney, allows glucose 6-phosphate generated by gluconeogenesis (both tissues) and glycogen breakdown (liver) to leave the cell. The absence of glucose 6-phosphatase from other tissues makes glucose uptake by these tissues essentially irreversible, consistent with the view that cells in these tissues take up glucose for local metabolic use.Class II facilitative transporters consist of GLUT5, 7, 9 and 11 (Zhao & Keating 2007, Wood & Trayhurn 2003).",NA,

The extensive conjugated porphyrin macrocycle is chromatic and the name itself, porphyrin, is derived from the Greek word for purple. The aromatic character of porphyrins can be seen by NMR spectroscopy.Porphyrins readily combine with metals by coordinating them in the central cavity. Iron (heme) and magnesium (chlorophyll) are two well known examples although zinc, copper, nickel and cobalt form other known metal-containing phorphyrins. A porphyrin which has no metal in the cavity is called a free base.Some iron-containing porphyrins are called hemes (heme-containing proteins or hemoproteins) and these are found extensively in nature ie. hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is quantitatively the most important hemoprotein. The hemoglobin iron is the transfer site of oxygen and carries it in the blood all round the body for cell respiration. Other examples are cytochromes?present in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum which takes part in electron transfer events, catalase and peroxidase whic protect the body against the oxidant hydrogen peroxide and tryptophan oxygenase which is present in intermediary metabolism.

Eight enzymes are involved in heme biosynthesis, four each in the mitochondria and the cytosol (Layer et al. 2010). The process starts in the mitochondria with the condensation of succinyl CoA (from the TCA cycle) and glycine to form 5-aminolevulinate (ALA). The next four steps take place in the cytosol. Two molecules of ALA are condensed to form the monopyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG). The next two steps convert four molecules of PBG into the cyclic tetrapyrrole uroporphyringen III, which is then decarboxylated into coproporphyrinogen III. The last three steps occur in the mitochondria and involve modifications to the tetrapyrrole side chains and finally, insertion of iron. In addition to these synthetic steps, a spontaneous cytosolic reaction allows the formation of uroporphyringen I which is then enzymatically decarboxylated to coproporphyrinogen?I, which cannot be metabolized further in humans. Also, lead can inactivate ALAD, the enzyme that catalyzes PBG synthesis, and ferrochelatase, the enzyme that catalyzes heme synthesis (Ponka et al. 1999, Aijoka et al. 2006).The porphyrias are disorders that arise from defects in the enzymes of heme biosynthesis. Defective pathway enzymes after ALA synthase result in accumulated substrates which can cause either skin problems, neurological complications, or both due to their toxicity in higher concentrations. They are broadly classified as hepatic porphyrias or erythropoietic porphyrias, based on the site of the overproduction of the substrate. Each defect is described together with the reaction it affects (Peoc'h et al. 2016).",NA,

NOTCH1 protein was identified first, as the product of a chromosome 9 gene translocated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that was homologous to Drosophila Notch (Ellisen et al. 1991). At the same time, rat Notch1 was cloned (Weinmaster et al. 1991), followed by cloning of mouse Notch1, named Motch (Del Amo et al. 1992). NOTCH2 protein is the product of a gene on chromosome 1 (Larsson et al. 1994). NOTCH2 expression is differentially regulated during B-cell development (Bertrand et al. 2000). NOTCH2 mutations are a rare cause of Alagille syndrome (McDaniell et al. 2006). NOTCH3 is the product of a gene on chromosome 19. NOTCH3 mutations are the underlying cause of CADASIL, cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (Joutel et al. 1996). NOTCH4, the last NOTCH protein discovered, is the product of a gene on chromosome 6 (Li et al. 1998). MicroRNAs play an important?negative role in translation and/or stability of NOTCH mRNAs. MicroRNAs miR-34 (miR-34A, miR-34B and mi-R34C), whose transcription is directly induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Chang et al. 2007, Raver-Shapira et al. 2007, He et al. 2007, Corney et al. 2007) bind and negatively regulate translation of NOTCH1 mRNA (Li et al. 2009, Pang et al. 2010, Ji et al. 2009) and NOTCH2 mRNA (Li et al. 2009). NOTCH1 mRNA translation is also negatively regulated by microRNAs miR-200B and miR-200C (Kong et al. 2010), as well as miR-449A, miR-449B and miR-449C (Marcet et al. 2011). Translation of NOTCH3 mRNA is negatively regulated by microRNAs miR-150 (Ghisi et al. 2011) and miR-206 (Song et al. 2009). Translation of NOTCH4 mRNA is negatively regulated by microRNAs miR-181C (Hashimoto et al. 2010) and miR-302A (Costa et al. 2009). Nascent NOTCH peptides are co-translationally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing, followed by modification in the Golgi apparatus, before trafficking to the plasma membrane. Endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases, positively regulate NOTCH trafficking, possibly by contributing to accurate folding of NOTCH precursors (Periz et al. 1999).",NA,

Movement of NOTCH precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi is controlled by SEL1L protein, a homolog of C. elegans sel-1. SEL1L localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and prevents translocation of misfolded proteins, therefore serving as a quality control check (Li et al. 2010, Sundaram et al. 1993, Francisco et al. 2010). Similarly, C. elegans sel-9 and its mammalian homolog TMED2 are Golgi membrane proteins that participate in quality control of proteins transported from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Translocation of a mutant C. elegans NOTCH homolog lin-12 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is negatively regulated by sel-9 (Wen et al. 1999). A GTPase RAB6 positively controls NOTCH trafficking through Golgi (Purcell et al. 1999). Processing of mammalian NOTCH precursors?in the Golgi typically involves the cleavage by FURIN convertase. Pre-NOTCH is a ~300 kDa protein, and cleavage by FURIN produces two fragments with approximate sizes of 110 kDa and 180 kDa. The 110 kDa fragment contains the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NOTCH and is known as NTM or NTMICD. The 189 kDa fragment contains NOTCH extracellular sequence and is known as NEC or NECD. The NTM and NEC fragments heterodimerize (Blaumueller et al. 1997, Logeat et al. 1998, Chan et al. 1998) and are held together by disulfide bonds and calcium ions (Rand et al. 2000, Gordon et al. 2009). An optional step in Pre-NOTCH processing in the Golgi is modification by fringe enzymes. Fringe enzymes are glycosyl transferases that initiate elongation of O-linked fucose on fucosylated peptides by addition of a beta 1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyl group, resulting in formation of disaccharide chains on NOTCH EGF repeats (GlcNAc-bet1,3-fucitol). Three fringe enzymes are known in mammals: LFNG (lunatic fringe), MFNG (manic fringe) and RFNG (radical fringe). LFNG shows the highest catalytic activity in modifying NOTCH (Bruckner et al. 2000, Moloney et al. 2000). Fringe-created disaccharide chains on NOTCH EGF repeats are further extended by B4GALT1 (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1), which adds galactose to the N-acetylglucosaminyl group, resulting in formation of trisaccharide Gal-beta1,4-GlcNAc-beta1,3-fucitol chains (Moloney et al. 2000, Chen et al. 2001). Formation of trisaccharide chains is the minimum requirement for fringe-mediated modulation of NOTCH signaling, although fringe-modified NOTCH expressed on the cell surface predominantly contains tetrasaccharide chains on EGF repeats. The tetrasaccharide chains are formed by sialyltransferase(s) that add sialic acid to galactose, resulting in formation of Sia-alpha2,3-Gal-beta1,4-GlcNAc-beta1,3-fucitol (Moloney et al. 2000). Three known Golgi membrane sialyltransferases could be performing this function: ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4 and ST3GAL6 (Harduin-Lepers et al. 2001). The modification of NOTCH by fringe enzymes modulates NOTCH-signaling by increasing the affinity of NOTCH receptors for delta-like ligands, DLL1 and DLL4, while decreasing affinity for jagged ligands, JAG1 and JAG2.",NA,

Their transcription is developmentally regulated and tissue specific, but very little information exists on molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Translation of NOTCH mRNAs is negatively regulated by a number of recently discovered microRNAs (Li et al. 2009, Pang et al.2010, Ji et al. 2009, Kong et al. 2010, Marcet et al. 2011, Ghisi et al. 2011, Song et al. 2009, Hashimoto et al. 2010, Costa et al. 2009). The nascent forms of NOTCH precursors, Pre-NOTCH1, Pre-NOTCH2, Pre-NOTCH3 and Pre-NOTCH4, undergo extensive posttranslational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to become functional. In the endoplasmic reticulum, conserved serine and threonine residues in the EGF repeats of NOTCH extracellular domain are fucosylated and glucosylated by POFUT1 and POGLUT1, respectively (Yao et al. 2011, Stahl et al. 2008,?Wang et al. 2001, Shao et al. 2003, Acar et al. 2008, Fernandez Valdivia et al. 2011). In the Golgi apparatus, fucose groups attached to NOTCH EGF repeats can be elongated by additional glycosylation steps initiated by fringe enzymes (Bruckner et al. 2000, Moloney et al. 2000, Cohen et al. 1997, Johnston et al. 1997, Chen et al. 2001). Fringe-mediated modification modulates NOTCH signaling but is not an obligatory step in Pre-NOTCH processing. Typically, processing of Pre-NOTCH in the Golgi involves cleavage by FURIN convertase (Blaumueller et al. 1997, Logeat et al. 1998, Gordon et al. 2009, Rand et al. 2000, Chan et al. 1998). The cleavage of NOTCH results in formation of mature NOTCH heterodimers that consist of NOTCH extracellular domain (NEC i.e. NECD) and NOTCH transmembrane and intracellular domain (NTM i.e. NTMICD).

The pathway then branches: hydroxylation of 4-cholesten-7alpha,27-diol-3-one to 4-cholesten-7alpha,12alpha,27-triol-3-one leads ultimately to the formation of cholate, while its reduction to 5beta-cholestan-7alpha,27-diol-3-one leads to chenodeoxycholate formation. In both branches, reactions in the cytosol, the mitochondrial matrix, and the peroxisomal matrix result in modifications to the ring structure, shortening and oxidation of the side chain,?conversion to a Coenzyme A derivative, and conjugation with the amino acids glycine or taurine (Russell 2003).

Newly synthesized bile salts are secreted into the bile and released into the small intestine where they emulsify dietary fats (Russell 2003). About 95% of the bile salts in the intestine are recovered and returned to the liver (Kullak-Ublick et al. 2004; Trauner and Boyer 2002). The major pathway for bile salt synthesis in the liver begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol. Bile salt synthesis can also begin with the synthesis of an oxysterol - 24-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the body, the initial steps of these two pathways occur in extrahepatic tissues, generating intermediates that are transported to the liver and converted to bile salts via the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathway. These extrahepatic pathways contribute little to the total synthesis of bile salts, but are thought to play important roles in extrahepatic cholesterol homeostasis (Javitt?2002).",NA,

In tumor progression, activation of VEGF pathways promotes tumor vascularization, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. Abnormal VEGF function is also associated with inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, and hyperthyroidism. The members of the VEGF and VEGF-receptor protein families have distinct but overlapping ligand-receptor specificities, cell-type expression, and function. VEGF-receptor activation in turn regulates a network of signaling processes in the body that promote endothelial cell growth, migration and survival (Hicklin and Ellis, 2005; Shibuya and Claesson-Welsh, 2006).Molecular features of the VGF signaling cascades are outlined in the figure below (from Olsson et al. 2006; Nature Publishing Group).

Miro GTPases and RHOBTB3 ATPase are sometimes described as Rho family members, but they are phylogenetically distinct (Boureux et al. 2007). Phylogenetically, RHO GTPases can be grouped into four clusters. The first cluster consists of three subfamilies: Rho, RhoD/RhoF and Rnd. The second cluster consists of three subfamilies: Rac, Cdc42 and RhoU/RhoV. The third cluster consists of the RhoH subfamily. The fourth cluster consists of the RhoBTB subfamily. Based on their activation type, RHO GTPases can be divided into classical (typical) and atypical (reviewed by Haga and Ridley 2016, and Kalpachidou et al. 2019). Classical RHO GTPases cycle between active GTP-bound states and inactive GDP-bound states through steps that are tightly controlled by members?of three classes of proteins: (1) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors or GDIs, which maintain Rho proteins in an inactive state in the cytoplasm, (2) guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs, which destabilize the interaction between Rho proteins and their bound nucleotide, the net result of which is the exchange of bound GDP for the more abundant GTP, and (3) GTPase activating proteins or GAPs, which stimulate the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Rho family members, thus promoting their inactivation. GDIs, GEFs, and GAPs are themselves subject to tight regulation, and the overall level of Rho activity reflects the balance of their activities. Many of the Rho-specific GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs act on multiple Rho GTPases, so that regulation of these control proteins can have complex effects on the functions of multiple Rho GTPases (reviewed by Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey 1997, Schmidt and Hall 2002, Jaffe and Hall 2005, Bernards 2005, and Hodge and Ridley 2016). Classical RHO GTPases include four subfamilies: Rho (includes RHOA, RHOB and RHOC), Rac (includes RAC1, RAC2, RAC3 and RHOG), Cdc42 (includes CDC42, RHOJ and RHOQ) and RhoD/RhoF (includes RHOD and RHOF) (reviewed in Haga and Ridley 2016). Atypical RHO GTPases do not possess GTPase activity. They therefore constitutively exist in the active GTP-bound state. Atypical RHO GTPases include three subfamilies: Rnd (includes RND1, RND2 and RND3), RhoBTB (includes RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2), RhoH (RHOH is the only member) and RhoU/RhoV (includes RHOU and RHOV). Members of the Rho family have been identified in all eukaryotes. Among Rho GTPases, RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42 have been most extensively studied.RHO GTPases regulate cell behavior by activating a number of downstream effectors that regulate cytoskeletal organization, intracellular trafficking and transcription (reviewed by Sahai and Marshall 2002). They are best known for their ability to induce dynamic rearrangements of the plasma membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton (Aspenstrom et al. 2004; Murphy et al. 1999; Govek et al. 2005). Beyond this function, Rho GTPases also regulate actomyosin contractility and microtubule dynamics. Rho mediated effects on transcription and membrane trafficking are believed to be secondary to these functions. At the more macroscopic level, Rho GTPases have been implicated in many important cell biological processes, including cell growth control, cytokinesis, cell motility, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, cell transformation and invasion, and development (Govek et al., 2005). One of the best studied RHO GTPase effectors are protein kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2, which phosphorylate many proteins involved in the stabilization of actin filaments and generation of actin-myosin contractile force, such as LIM kinases and myosin regulatory light chains (MRLC) (reviewed in Riento and Ridley 2003). The p21-activated kinase family, which includes PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3, is another well characterized family of RHO GTPase effectors involved in cytoskeleton regulation (reviewed in Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009). Protein kinase C related kinases (PKNs), PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 play important roles in cytoskeleton organization (Hamaguchi et al. 2000), regulation of cell cycle (Misaki et al. 2001), receptor trafficking (Metzger et al. 2003), apoptosis (Takahashi et al. 1998), and transcription (Metzger et al. 2003, Metzger et al. 2005, Metzger et al. 2008). Citron kinase (CIT) is involved in Golgi apparatus organization through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Camera et al. 2003) and in the regulation of cytokinesis (Gruneberg et al. 2006, Bassi et al. 2013, Watanabe et al. 2013). Kinectin (KTN1), a kinesin anchor protein, is a RHO GTPase effector involved in kinesin-mediated vesicle motility (Vignal et al. 2001, Hotta et al. 1996), including microtubule-dependent lysosomal transport (Vignal et al. 2001). IQGAP proteins, IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, are RHO GTPase effectors that modulate cell shape and motility through regulation of G-actin/F-actin equilibrium (Brill et al. 1996, Fukata et al. 1997, Bashour et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2007, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011), regulate adherens junctions (Kuroda et al. 1998, Hage et al. 2009), and contribute to cell polarity and lamellipodia formation (Fukata et al. 2002, Suzuki and Takahashi 2008). WASP and WAVE proteins (reviewed by Lane et al. 2014), as well as formins (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014), are RHO GTPase effectors that regulate actin polymerization and play important roles in cell motility, organelle trafficking and mitosis. Rhotekin (RTKN) and rhophilins (RHPN1 and RHPN2) are RHO GTPase effectors that regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and are implicated in the establishment of cell polarity, cell motility and possibly endosome trafficking (Sudo et al. 2006, Watanabe et al. 1996, Fujita et al. 2000, Peck et al. 2002, Mircescu et al. 2002). Cytoskeletal changes triggered by the activation of formins (Miralles et al. 2003) and RTKN (Reynaud et al. 2000) may lead to stimulation of SRF-mediated transcription. NADPH oxidase complexes 1, 2 and 3 (NOX1, NOX2 and NOX3), membrane associated enzymatic complexes that use NADPH as an electron donor to reduce oxygen and produce superoxide (O2-), are also regulated by RHO GTPases (Knaus et al. 1991, Roberts et al. 1999, Kim and Dinauer 2001, Jyoti et al. 2014, Cheng et al. 2006, Miyano et al. 2006, Ueyama et al. 2006). Every RHO GTPase activates multiple downstream effectors and most effectors are regulated by multiple RHO GTPases, resulting in an elaborate cross-talk.",NA,

ROCK1 and ROCK2 phosphorylate many proteins involved in the stabilization of actin filaments and generation of actin-myosin contractile force, such as LIM kinases and myosin regulatory light chains (MRLC) (Amano et al. 1996, Ishizaki et al. 1996, Leung et al. 1996, Ohashi et al. 2000, Sumi et al. 2001, Riento and Ridley 2003, Watanabe et al. 2007).PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3, members of the p21-activated kinase family, are activated by binding to RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 and subsequent autophosphorylation and are involved in cytoskeleton regulation (Manser et al. 1994, Manser et al. 1995, Zhang et al. 1998, Edwards et al. 1999, Lei et al. 2000, Parrini et al.?2002; reviewed by Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009).RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 activate protein kinase C related kinases (PKNs) PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 (Maesaki et al. 1999, Zong et al. 1999, Owen et al. 2003, Modha et al. 2008, Hutchinson et al. 2011, Hutchinson et al. 2013), bringing them in proximity to the PIP3-activated PDPK1 (PDK1) and thus enabling PDPK1-mediated phosphorylation of PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003). PKNs play important roles in cytoskeleton organization (Hamaguchi et al. 2000), regulation of cell cycle (Misaki et al. 2001), receptor trafficking (Metzger et al. 2003) and apoptosis (Takahashi et al. 1998). PKN1 is also involved in the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by the androgen receptor (Metzger et al. 2003, Metzger et al. 2005, Metzger et al. 2008).Citron kinase (CIT) binds RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 (Madaule et al. 1995), but the mechanism of CIT activation by GTP-bound RHO GTPases has not been elucidated. CIT and RHOA are implicated to act together in Golgi apparatus organization through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Camera et al. 2003). CIT is also involved in the regulation of cytokinesis through its interaction with KIF14 (Gruneberg et al. 2006, Bassi et al. 2013, Watanabe et al. 2013).RHOA, RHOG, RAC1 and CDC42 bind kinectin (KTN1), a kinesin anchor protein involved in kinesin-mediated vesicle motility (Vignal et al. 2001, Hotta et al. 1996). The effect of RHOG activity on cellular morphology, exhibited in the formation of microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, depends both on RHOG interaction with KTN1, as well as on the kinesin activity (Vignal et al. 2001). RHOG and KTN1 also cooperate in microtubule-dependent lysosomal transport (Vignal et al. 2001).IQGAP proteins IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, bind RAC1 and CDC42 and stabilize them in their GTP-bound state (Kuroda et al. 1996, Swart-Mataraza et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2007). IQGAPs bind F-actin filaments and modulate cell shape and motility through regulation of G-actin/F-actin equilibrium (Brill et al. 1996, Fukata et al. 1997, Bashour et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2007, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Binding of IQGAPs to F-actin is inhibited by calmodulin (Bashour et al. 1997, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). IQGAP1 is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions through its interaction with E-cadherin (CDH1) and catenins (CTTNB1 and CTTNA1) (Kuroda et al. 1998, Hage et al. 2009). IQGAP1 contributes to cell polarity and lamellipodia formation through its interaction with microtubules (Fukata et al. 2002, Suzuki and Takahashi 2008).RHOQ (TC10) regulates the trafficking of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) by binding to the Golgi-associated protein GOPC (also known as PIST, FIG and CAL). In the absence of RHOQ, GOPC bound to CFTR directs CFTR for lysosomal degradation, while GTP-bound RHOQ directs GOPC:CFTR complex to the plasma membrane, thereby rescuing CFTR (Neudauer et al. 2001, Cheng et al. 2005).RAC1 and CDC42 activate WASP and WAVE proteins, members of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein family. WASPs and WAVEs simultaneously interact with G-actin and the actin-related ARP2/3 complex, acting as nucleation promoting factors in actin polymerization (reviewed by Lane et al. 2014).RHOA, RHOB, RHOC, RAC1 and CDC42 activate a subset of formin family members. Once activated, formins bind G-actin and the actin-bound profilins and accelerate actin polymerization, while some formins also interact with microtubules. Formin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization plays important roles in cell motility, organelle trafficking and mitosis (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014).Rhotekin (RTKN) and rhophilins (RHPN1 and RHPN2) are effectors of RHOA, RHOB and RHOC and have not been studied in detail. They regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and are implicated in the establishment of cell polarity, cell motility and possibly endosome trafficking (Sudo et al. 2006, Watanabe et al. 1996, Fujita et al. 2000, Peck et al. 2002, Mircescu et al. 2002). Similar to formins (Miralles et al. 2003), cytoskeletal changes triggered by RTKN activation may lead to stimulation of SRF-mediated transcription (Reynaud et al. 2000).RHO GTPases RAC1 and RAC2 are needed for activation of NADPH oxidase complexes 1, 2 and 3 (NOX1, NOX2 and NOX3), membrane associated enzymatic complexes that use NADPH as an electron donor to reduce oxygen and produce superoxide (O2-). Superoxide serves as a secondary messenger and also directly contributes to the microbicidal activity of neutrophils (Knaus et al. 1991, Roberts et al. 1999, Kim and Dinauer 2001, Jyoti et al. 2014, Cheng et al. 2006, Miyano et al. 2006, Ueyama et al. 2006)",NA,

The pathway is named for the WNT ligands, a large family of secreted cysteine-rich glycoproteins. At least 19 WNT members have been identified in humans and mice with distinct expression patterns during development (reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012). These ligands can activate at least three different downstream signaling cascades depending on which receptors they engage. In the so-called 'canonical' WNT signaling pathway, WNT ligands bind one of the 10 human Frizzled (FZD) receptors in conjunction with the LRP5/6 co-receptors to activate a transcriptional cascade that controls processes such as cell fate, proliferation and self-renenwal of stem cells. Engagement of the FZD-LRP receptor by WNT ligand results in the stabilization and translocation?of cytosolic beta-catenin to the nucleus where it is a co-activator for LEF (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor)- and TCF (T cell factor) -dependent transcription. In the absence of WNT ligand, cytosolic beta-catenin is phosphorylated by a degradation complex consisting of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), casein kinase 1 (CK1), Axin and Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; Kimmelman and Xu, 2006). In addition to the beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional response, WNT signaling can also activate distinct non-transcriptional pathways that regulate cell migration and polarity. These beta-catenin-independent 'non-canonical' pathways signal through Frizzled receptors independently of LRP5/6, or occur through the tyrosine kinase receptors ROR and RYK (reviewed in Veeman et al, 2003; James et al, 2009). Non-canonical WNT pathways are best studied in Drosophila where the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls the orientation of wing hairs and eye facets, but are also involved in processes such as convergent extension, neural tube closure, inner ear development and hair orientation in vertebrates and mammals(reviewed in Seifert and Mlodzik, 2007; Simons and Mlodzik, 2008). In the PCP pathway, binding of WNT ligand to the FZD receptor leads to activation of small Rho GTPases and JNK, which regulate the cytoskeleton and coordinate cell migration and polarity (reviewed in Lai et al, 2009; Schlessinger et al, 2009). In some cases, a FZD-WNT interaction increases intracellular calcium concentration and activates CaMK II and PKC; this WNT calcium pathway promotes cell migration and inhibits the canonical beta-catenin dependent transcriptional pathway (reviewed in Kuhl et al, 2000; Kohn and Moon, 2005; Rao et al 2010). Binding of WNT to ROR or RYK receptors also regulates cell migration, apparently through activation of JNK or SRC kinases, respectively, however the details of these pathways remain to be worked out (reviewed in Minami et al, 2010). Although the WNT signaling pathways were originally viewed as discrete, linear pathways controlled by defined subsets of 'canonical' or 'non-canonical' ligands and receptors, the emerging evidence is challenging this notion. Instead, the specificity and the downstream response appear to depend on the particular cellular context and vary with species, tissue and stage of development (reviewed in van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009; Rao et al, 2010)",NA,

In the body, the fate of pregnenolone is tissue-specific: in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex it is converted to cortisol, in the zona glomerulosa to aldosterone, and in the gonads to testosterone and then to estrone and estradiol.

Cholesterol transport appears to be rate-limiting for steroid hormone synthesis and its regulation, at the step of StAR-mediated traversal of the mitochondrial membrane, plays a central role in determining the amounts and identities of steroid hormones made in the body. In the inner mitochondrial membrane, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone in a sequence of three reactions, all catalyzed by CYP11A (side chain cleavage enzyme).

It is obtained from the diet and produced in the skin by photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol and released into the bloodstream. Very few foods (eg. oily fish, mushrooms exposed to sunlight and cod liver oil) are natural sources of vitamin D. A small number of countries in the world artificially fortify a few foods with vitamin D. The metabolites of vitamin D are carried in the circulation bound to a plasma protein called vitamin D binding protein (GC) (for review see Delanghe et al. 2015, Chun 2012). Vitamin D undergoes two subsequent hydroxylations to form the active form of the vitamin, 1-alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). The first hydroxylation takes place in the liver followed by subsequent transport to the kidney where the second hydroxylation takes place. 1,25(OH)2D acts by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors (Neme et al.?2017) and it has been estimated that upwards of 2000 genes are directly or indirectly regulated which are involved in calcium homeostasis, immune responses, cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis (Hossein-nezhad et al. 2013, Hossein-nezhad & Holick 2013).

In the canonical WNT signaling pathway, binding of a WNT ligand to the Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) receptors results in the inactivation of the destruction complex, the stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and subsequent activation of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF)-dependent transcription. Transcriptional activation in response to canonical WNT signaling controls processes such as cell fate, proliferation and self renewal of stem cells, as well as contributing to oncogenesis (reviewed in MacDonald et al, 2009; Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; Kim et al, 2013).",NA,

DVL activity is regulated by phosphorylation, although the details are not completely worked out. DVL likely exists as a phosphoprotein even in the absence of WNT stimulation, and is further phosphorylated upon ligand binding. Casein kinase 1epsilon (CSNK1E), casein kinase 2 (CSNK2) and PAR1 have all been reported to phosphorylate DVL (Willert et al, 1997; Sun et al, 2001; Cong et al, 2004; Ossipova et al, 2005). Upon pathway activation, phosphorylated DVL translocates to the plasma membrane through an interaction between the DVL PDZ domain and the FZD KTxxxW motif (Wong et al, 2003; Umbhauer et al, 2000; Kikuchi et al, 2011). At the plasma membrane, DVL is believed to oligomerize through its DIX domain, providing a platform for AXIN recruitment; recruitment of AXIN is also facilitated by interaction with LRP?(Schwarz-Romond et al, 2007; Mao et al, 2001). DVL interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase type II (PI4KII) and phophatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type I (PIP5KI) to promote formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the membrane, which is required for the clustering and phosphorylation of LRP6 and the recruitment of AXIN (Pan et al, 2008; Qin et al, 2009)",NA,

This family, which consists of TCF7 (also known as TCF1), TCF7L1 (also known as TCF3), TCF7L2 (also known as TCF4) and TCF7L3 (also known as LEF1), are HMG-containing transcription factors that bind to the WNT responsive elements in target gene promoters (reviewed in Brantjes et al, 2002). In the absence of WNT signal, TCF/LEF proteins recruit Groucho/TLE repressors to inhibit transcription; upon WNT stimulation, beta-catenin can displace Groucho/TLE from TCF/LEF proteins to initiate transcriptional activation (reviewed in Chen and Courey, 2000). Although this model for WNT-dependent activation of target genes is widely accepted, it is important to note that TCF/LEF proteins are not redundant and can contribute to WNT target gene expression in a number of different ways (reviewed in Brantjes et al, 2002; MacDonald et al, 2009). In particular, TCF7L1 (TCF3) is thought?to have a more pronounced repressor function than other TCF/LEF family members. A couple of recent studies in Xenopus and mammalian cells show that WNT- and beta-catenin-dependent phosphorylation of TCF7L1(TCF3) promotes its dissociation from the promoter of target genes and allows gene expression through relief of this repression activity (Hikasa et al, 2010; Hikasa et al, 2011).The role of beta-catenin at WNT promoters hinges upon its ability to act as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins. The structure of beta-catenin consists of 12 imperfect ARM repeats (R1-12) flanked by an N-terminal and C-terminal extension (NTD and CTD respectively), with a conserved Helix C located between R12 and the CTD. Nuclear beta-catenin interacts with TCF/LEF at WNT target genes through ARM domains 3-9 (Graham et al, 2000; Poy et al, 2001; Xing et al, 2008). The N and the C terminal regions are important for the recruitment of transcriptional activator and repressors that contribute to WNT target gene expression (reviewed in Mosimann et al, 2009; Valenta et al, 2012). The N-terminal ARM domains 1-4 recruit the WNT-pathway specific activators BCL9:PYGO while the C-terminal region (R11-CTD) interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators that are involved in chromatin remodelling and transcription initiation. These include HATs such as P300, CBP and TIP60, histone methyltransferases such as MLL1 and 2, SWI/SNF factors BRG1 and ISWI and components of the PAF complex (reviewed in Mosimann et al, 2009; Valenta et al, 2012). Although many binding partners have been identified for the C-terminal region of beta-catenin, in many cases the timing and relationship of these interactions and indeed, the exact complex composition remains to be elucidated. Moreover, because many of the interacting partners appear to bind to overlapping regions of beta-catenin, it is unlikely that they all bind simultaneously. For simplicity, the interactions have been depicted as though they occur independently of one another; more accurately they are likely to cycle successively on and off beta-catenin to promote an active chromatin structure (reviewed in Willert and Jones, 2006; Valenta et al, 2012).",NA,

NO is a highly active molecule that diffuses across cell membranes and cannot be stored inside the producing cell. Its signaling capacity is controlled at the levels of biosynthesis and local availability. Its production by NO synthases is under complex and tight control, being regulated at transcriptional and translational levels, through co- and posttranslational modifications, and by subcellular localization. NO is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Three NOS isoforms have been characterized: neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS1) primarily found in neuronal tissue and skeletal muscle; inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2) originally isolated from macrophages and later discovered in many other cell types; and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS3) present?in vascular endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and in blood platelets. The enzymatic activity of all three isoforms is dependent on calmodulin, which binds to nNOS and eNOS at elevated intracellular calcium levels, while it is tightly associated with iNOS even at basal calcium levels. As a result, the enzymatic activity of nNOS and eNOS is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium levels, leading to transient NO production, while iNOS continuously releases NO independent of fluctuations in intracellular calcium levels and is mainly regulated at the gene expression level (Pacher et al. 2007).The NOS enzymes share a common basic structural organization and requirement for substrate cofactors for enzymatic activity. A central calmodulin-binding motif separates an NH2-terminal oxygenase domain from a COOH-terminal reductase domain. Binding sites for cofactors NADPH, FAD, and FMN are located within the reductase domain, while binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and heme are located within the oxygenase domain. Once calmodulin binds, it facilitates electron transfer from the cofactors in the reductase domain to heme enabling nitric oxide production. Both nNOS and eNOS contain an additional insert (40-50 amino acids) in the middle of the FMN-binding subdomain that serves as autoinhibitory loop, destabilizing calmodulin binding at low calcium levels and inhibiting electron transfer from FMN to the heme in the absence of calmodulin. iNOS does not contain this insert. In this Reactome pathway module, details of eNOS activation and regulation are annotated. Originally identified as endothelium-derived relaxing factor, eNOS derived NO is a critical signaling molecule in vascular homeostasis. It regulates blood pressure and vascular tone, and is involved in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. Loss of endothelium derived NO is a key feature of endothelial dysfunction, implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis. The endothelial isoform eNOS is unique among the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family in that it is co-translationally modified at its amino terminus by myristoylation and is further acylated by palmitoylation (two residues next to the myristoylation site). These modifications target eNOS to the plasma membrane caveolae and lipid rafts. Factors that stimulate eNOS activation and nitric oxide (NO) production include fluid shear stress generated by blood flow, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bradykinin, estrogen, insulin, and angiopoietin. The activity of eNOS is further regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and subcellular localization. Following activation, eNOS shuttles between caveolae and other subcellular compartments such as the noncaveolar plasma membrane portions, Golgi apparatus, and perinuclear structures. This subcellular distribution is variable depending upon cell type and mode of activation. Subcellular localization of eNOS has a profound effect on its ability to produce NO as the availability of its substrates and cofactors will vary with location. eNOS is primarily particulate, and depending on the cell type, eNOS can be found in several membrane compartments: plasma membrane caveolae, lipid rafts, and intracellular membranes such as the Golgi complex.",NA,

For fibrillar collagens namely types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum 2011) secretion is concomitant with processing of the N and C terminal collagen propeptides. These processed molecules are known as tropocollagens, considered to be the units of higher order collagen structures. They form within the extracellular space via a process that can proceed spontaneously, but in the cellular environment is regulated by many collagen binding proteins such as the FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices) family collagens and Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycans (SLRPs). The architecture formed ultimately depends on the collagen subtype and the cellular conditions. Structures include the well-known fibrils and fibres formed by the major structural?collagens type I and II plus several different types of supramolecular assembly (Bruckner 2010). The mechanical and physical properties of tissues depend on the spatial arrangement and composition of these collagen-containing structures (Kadler et al. 1996, Shoulders & Raines 2009, Birk & Bruckner 2011). Fibrillar collagen structures are frequently heterotypic, composed of a major collagen type in association with smaller amounts of other types, e.g. type I collagen fibrils are associated with types III and V, while type II fibrils frequently contain types IX and XI (Wess 2005). Fibres composed exclusively of a single collagen type probably do not exist, as type I and II fibrils require collagens V and XI respectively as nucleators (Kadler et al. 2008, Wenstrup et al. 2011). Much of the structural understanding of collagen fibrils has been obtained with fibril-forming collagens, particularly type I, but some central features are believed to apply to at least the other fibrillar collagen subtypes (Wess 2005). Fibril diameter and length varies considerably, depending on the tissue and collagen types (Fang et al. 2012). The reasons for this are poorly understood (Wess 2005).Some tissues such as skin have fibres that are approximately the same diameter while others such as tendon or cartilage have a bimodal distribution of thick and thin fibrils. Mature type I collagen fibrils in tendon are up to 1 cm in length, with a diameter of approx. 500 nm. An individual fibrillar collagen triple helix is less than 1.5 nm in diameter and around 300 nm long; collagen molecules must assemble to give rise to the higher-order fibril structure, a process known as fibrillogenesis, prevented by the presence of C-terminal propeptides (Kadler et al. 1987). In electron micrographs, fibrils have a banded appearance, due to regular gaps where fewer collagen molecules overlap, which occur because the fibrils are aligned in a quarter-stagger arrangement (Hodge & Petruska 1963). Collagen microfibrils are believed to have a quasi-hexagonal unit cell, with tropocollagen arranged to form supertwisted, right-handed microfibrils that interdigitate with neighbouring microfibrils, leading to a spiral-like structure for the mature collagen fibril (Orgel et al. 2006, Holmes & Kadler 2006).Neighbouring tropocollagen monomers interact with each other and are cross-linked covalently by lysyl oxidase (Orgel et al. 2000, Maki 2006). Mature collagen fibrils are stabilized by lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-links. Hydroxylysyl pyridinoline and lysyl pyridinoline cross-links form between (hydroxy) lysine and hydroxylysine residues in bone and cartilage (Eyre et al. 1984). Arginoline cross-links can form in cartilage (Eyre et al. 2010); mature bovine articular cartilage contains roughly equimolar amounts of arginoline and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline based on peptide yields. Mature collagen fibrils in skin are stabilized by the lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-link histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (Yamauch et al. 1987). Due to the quarter-staggered arrangement of collagen molecules in a fibril, telopeptides most often interact with the triple helix of a neighbouring collagen molecule in the fibril, except for collagen molecules in register staggered by 4D from another collagen molecule. Fibril aggregation in vitro can be unipolar or bipolar, influenced by temperature and levels of C-proteinase, suggesting a role for the N- and C- propeptides in regulation of the aggregation process (Kadler et al. 1996). In vivo, collagen molecules at the fibril surface may retain their N-propeptides, suggesting that this may limit further accretion, or alternatively represents a transient stage in a model whereby fibrils grow in diameter through a cycle of deposition, cleavage and further deposition (Chapman 1989).In vivo, fibrils are often composed from more than one type of collagen. Type III collagen is found associated with type I collagen in dermal fibrils, with the collagen III on the periphery, suggesting a regulatory role (Fleischmajer et al. 1990). Type V collagen associates with type I collagen fibrils, where it may limit fibril diameter (Birk et al. 1990, White et al. 1997). Type IX associates with the surface of narrow diameter collagen II fibrils in cartilage and the cornea (Wu et al. 1992, Eyre et al. 2004). Highly specific patterns of crosslinking sites suggest that collagen IX functions in interfibrillar networking (Wess 2005). Type XII and XIV collagens are localized near the surface of banded collagen I fibrils (Nishiyama et al. 1994). Certain fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) associate with the surface of collagen fibrils, where they may serve to limit fibril fusion and thereby regulate fibril diameter (Gordon & Hahn 2010). Collagen XV, a member of the multiplexin family, is almost exclusively associated with the fibrillar collagen network, in very close proximity to the basement membrane. In human tissues collagen XV is seen linking banded collagen fibers subjacent to the basement membrane (Amenta et al. 2005). Type XIV collagen, SLRPs and discoidin domain receptors also regulate fibrillogenesis (Ansorge et al. 2009, Kalamajski et al. 2010, Flynn et al. 2010).Collagen IX is cross-linked to the surface of collagen type II fibrils (Eyre et al. 1987). Type XII and XIV collagens are found in association with type I (Walchli et al. 1994) and type II (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002) fibrils in cartilage. They are thought to associate non-covalently via their COL1/NC1 domains (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002). Some non-fibrillar collagens form supramolecular assemblies that are distinct from typical fibrils. Collagen VII forms anchoring fibrils, composed of antiparallel dimers that connect the dermis to the epidermis (Bruckner-Tuderman 2009). During fibrillogenesis, the nascent type VII procollagen molecules dimerize in an antiparallel manner. The C-propeptides are then removed by Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (Rattenholl et al. 2002) and the processed antiparallel dimers aggregate laterally. Collagens VIII and X form hexagonal networks and collagen VI forms beaded filament (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum et al. 2011).",NA,

Renin, an aspartyl protease specific for angiotensinogen, is secreted into the bloodstream by juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to a drop in blood pressure. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to yield a decapaptide, angiotensin I (angiotensin-1, angiotensin-(1-10)). Circulating renin can also bind the membrane-localized (pro)renin receptor (ATP6AP2) which increases its catalytic activity. After cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by renin, two C-terminal amino acid residues of angiotensin I are removed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), located on the surface of endothelial cells, to yield angiotensin II (angiotensin-2, angiotensin-(1-8)), the active peptide that causes vasoconstriction, resorption of sodium and chloride, excretion of potassium, water retention, and aldosterone secretion.More recently?other, more tissue-localized pathways leading to angiotensin II and alternative derivatives of angiotensinogen have been identified (reviewed in Kramkowski et al. 2006, Kumar et al. 2007, Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008, Becari et al. 2011). Chymase, cathepsin G, and cathepsin X (cathepsin Z) can each cleave angiotensin I to yield angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves 1 amino acid residue from angiotensin I (angiotensin-(1-10)) to yield angiotensin-(1-9), which can be cleaved by ACE to yield angiotensin-(1-7). ACE2 can also cleave angiotensin II to yield angiotensin-(1-7). Neprilysin can cleave either angiotensin-(1-9) or angiotensin I to yield angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin-(1-7) binds the MAS receptor (MAS1, MAS proto-oncogene) and, interestingly, produces effects opposite to those produced by angiotensin II.Aminopeptidase A (APA, ENPEP) cleaves angiotensin II to yield angiotensin III (angiotensin-(2-8)), which is then cleaved by aminopeptidase N (APN, ANPEP) yielding angiotensin IV (angiotensin-(3-8)). Angiotensin IV binds the AT4 receptor (AT4R, IRAP, LNPEP, oxytocinase).Inhibitors of renin (e.g. aliskiren) and ACE (e.g. lisinopril, ramipril) are currently used to treat hypertension (reviewed in Gerc et al. 2009, Verdecchia et al. 2010, Alreja and Joseph 2011)",NA,

Three transcription factors in particular have been found to play a key role in TCR-stimulated changes in gene expression, namely NFkappaB, NFAT and AP-1. A key step in NFkappaB activation is the stimulation and translocation of PRKCQ. The critical element that effects PRKCQ activation is PI3K. PI3K translocates to the plasma membrane by interacting with phospho-tyrosines on CD28 via its two SH2 domains located in p85 subunit (step 24). The p110 subunit of PI3K phosphorylates the inositol ring of PIP2 to generate PIP3 (steps 25). The reverse dephosphorylation process from PIP3 to PIP2 is catalysed by PTEN (step 27). PIP3 may also be dephosphorylated by the phosphatase SHIP to generate PI-3,4-P2 (step 26). PIP3 and PI-3,4-P2 acts as binding sites to the PH domain of PDK1 (step 28) and AKT (step 29). PKB is activated in response to PI3K stimulation by PDK1 (step 30). PDK1 has an essential role in regulating the activation of PRKCQ and recruitment of CBM complex to the immune synapse. PRKCQ is a member of novel class (DAG dependent, Ca++ independent) of PKC and the only member known to translocate to this synapse. Prior to TCR stimulation PRKCQ exists in an inactive closed conformation. TCR signals stimulate PRKCQ (step 31) and release DAG molecules. Subsequently, DAG binds to PRKCQ via the C1 domain and undergoes phosphorylation on tyrosine 90 by LCK to attain an open conformation (step 32). PRKCQ is further phosphorylated by PDK1 on threonine 538 (step 33). This step is critical for PKC activity. CARMA1 translocates to the plasma membrane following the interaction of its SH3 domain with the 'PxxP' motif on PDK1 (step 34). CARMA1 is phosphorylated by PKC-theta on residue S552 (step 35), leading to the oligomerization of CARMA1. This complex acts as a scaffold, recruiting BCL10 to the synapse by interacting with their CARD domains (step 36). BCL10 undergoes phosphorylation mediated by the enzyme RIP2 (step 37). Activated BCL10 then mediates the ubiquitination of IKBKG by recruiting MALT1 and TRAF6. MALT1 binds to BCL10 with its Ig-like domains and undergoes oligomerization (step 38). TRAF6 binds to the oligomerized MALT1 and also undergoes oligomerization (step 39). Oligomerized TRAF6 acts as a ubiquitin-protein ligase, catalyzing auto-K63-linked polyubiquitination (step 40). This K-63 ubiquitinated TRAF6 activates MAP3K7 kinase bound to TAB2 (step 41) and also ubiquitinates IKBKG in the IKK complex (step 44). MAP3K7 undergoes autophosphorylation on residues T184 and T187 and gets activated (step 42). Activated MAP3K7 kinase phosphorylates IKBKB on residues S177 and S181 in the activation loop and activates the IKK kinase activity (step 43). IKBKB phosphorylates the NFKBIA bound to the NFkappaB heterodimer, on residues S19 and S23 (step 45) and directs NFKBIA to 26S proteasome degradation (step 47).

Upon TCR stimulation, CSK dissociates from PAG1 (step 3) and PTPN22 (step4) and is unable to inhibit LCK. Furthermore, LCK becomes activated via PTPRC-mediated dephosphorylation of negative regulatory tyrosine residues (step 5).

An early step in phagocytic signaling is the association of PIP2 and IP3 with the phagocytic cup. These are formed by the activity of phosphoinositol kinases and phospholipases. PI3K is has been shown to accumulate at phagocytic cups and converts PI (4,5)P2 to PI (3,4,5)P3. These phosphoinositides are capable of binding and increasing the activity of proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Phospholipases are lipid modifying enzymes that produce lipid mediators such as diacylglycerol (DAG), arachidonic acid (AA) and IP3. Phopsholipases PLA, PLC and PLD have been shown to be involved in antibody (IgG) mediated phagocytosis. The PLC product IP3 stimulates release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum.

As is the case for the other receptors, many of the activating mutations that are seen in FGFR3-related cancers mimic the germline FGFR3 mutations that give rise to autosomal skeletal disorders and include both ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Burke et al, 1998; Wesche et al, 2011). In addition to activating mutations, the FGFR3 gene is subject to a translocation event in 15% of multiple myelomas (Avet-Loiseau et al, 1998; Chesi et al, 1997). This chromosomal rearrangement puts the FGFR3 gene under the control of the highly active IGH promoter and promotes overexpression and constitutive activation of FGFR3 (Otsuki et al, 1999). In a small proportion of multiple myelomas, the translocation event is accompanied?by activating mutations in the FGFR3 coding sequence (Chesi et al, 1997; Onwuazor et al, 2003; Ronchetti et al, 2001).Finally, FGFR3 is subject to fusion events in a number of cancers, including lung, bladder and glioblastoma (Singh et al, 2012; Parker et al, 2013; Williams et al, 2013; Wu et al, 2013; Capelletti et al, 2014; Yuan et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2014; Carneiro et al, 2015; reviewed in Parker et al, 2014).

Mutations that give rise to Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss and Pfeiffer syndromes tend to cluster in the third Ig-like domain of the receptor, either in exon IIIa (shared by the IIIb and the IIIc isoforms) or in the FGFR2c-specific exon IIIc. These mutations frequently involve creation or removal of a cysteine residue, leading to the formation of an unpaired cysteine residue that is thought to promote intramolecular dimerization and thus constitutive, ligand-independent activation (reviewed in Burke, 1998; Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Cunningham, 2007). Mutations in FGFR2 that give rise to Apert Syndrome cluster to the highly conserved Pro-Ser dipeptide in the IgII-Ig III linker; mutations in?the paralogous residues of FGFR1 and 3 give rise to Pfeiffer and Muenke syndromes, respectively (Muenke, 1994; Wilkie, 1995; Bellus, 1996). Development of Beare-Stevensen cutis gyrata is associated with mutations in the transmembrane-proximal region of the receptor (Przylepa, 1996), and similar mutations in FGFR3 are linked to the development of thanatophoric dysplasia I (Tavormina, 1995a). These mutations all affect FGFR2 signaling without altering the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor.Activating point mutations have also been identified in FGFR2 in ~15% of endometrial cancers, as well as to a lesser extent in ovarian and gastric cancers (Dutt, 2008; Pollock, 2007; Byron, 2010; Jang, 2001). These mutations are found largely in the extracellular region and in the kinase domain of the receptor, and parallel activating mutations seen in autosomal dominant disorders described above.Activating mutations in FGFR2 are thought to contribute to receptor activation through diverse mechanisms, including constitutive ligand-independent dimerization (Robertson, 1998), expanded range and affinity for ligand (Ibrahimi, 2004b; Yu, 2000) and enhanced kinase activity (Byron, 2008; Chen, 2007).",NA,

Several agonists that raise intracellular calcium concentrations promote calmodulin binding to eNOS and the dissociation of caveolin from the enzyme, leading to an activated eNOS-calmodulin complex.Phosphorylation plays a significant role in regulating eNOS activity, especially the phosphorylation of Ser1177, located within the reductase domain, which increases enzyme activity by enhancing reductase activity and calcium sensitivity. In unstimulated, cultured endothelial cells, Ser1177 is rapidly phosphorylated following a variety of stimuli: fluid shear stress, insulin, estrogen, VEGF, or bradykinin. The kinases?involved in this process depend upon the stimuli applied. For instance, shear stress phosphorylates Ser1177 by activating Akt and PKA; insulin activates both Akt and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); estrogen and VEGF mainly phosphorylate eNOS via Akt; whereas the bradykinin-induced phosphorylation of Ser1177 is mediated by CaMKII. When Ser1177 is phosphorylated, NO production is increased several-fold above basal levels.The phosphorylation of a threonine residue (Thr 495), located in the CaM binding domain, is associated with a decrease in eNOS activity. When this residue is dephosphorylated, substantially more CaM binds to eNOS and elevates enzyme activity. Stimuli associated with dephosphorylation of Thr495 (e.g., bradykinin, histamine, and Ca2+ ionophores) also increase Ca2+ levels resulting in the phosphorylation of Ser1177.Additional phosphorylation sites, such as Ser114 and Ser633, and tyrosine phosphorylation have all been detected, but their functional relevance remains unclear. It is speculated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS is unlikely to affect enzyme activity directly, but more likely to impact the protein-protein interactions with associated scaffolding and regulatory proteins",NA,

Transcription. miRNA transcripts may come from autonomously transcribed genes, they may be contained in cotranscripts with other genes, or they may be located in introns of host genes. Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, however a few miRNAs originate as RNA polymerase III cotranscripts with neighboring repetitive elements. The initial transcript, termed a primary microRNA (pri-miRNA), contains an imperfectly double-stranded region within a hairpin loop. Longer sequences extend from the 5' and 3' ends of the hairpin and may also contain double-stranded regions. 2. Cleavage by DROSHA. The 5' and 3' ends of the pri-miRNA are removed during endoribonucleolytic cleavage by the DROSHA nuclease in a complex with the RNA-binding protein DGCR8 (the Microprocessor complex). The cleavage product is a short hairpin?of about 60 to 70 nt called the pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA). 3. Nuclear export by Exportin-5. The resulting pre-miRNA is bound by Exportin-5 in a complex with Ran and GTP. The complex translocates the pre-miRNA through the nuclear pore into the cytoplasm. 4. Cleavage by DICER1. Once in the cytoplasm the pre-miRNA is bound by the RISC loading complex which contains DICER1, an Argonaute protein and either TARBP2 or PRKRA. DICER1 cleaves the pre-miRNA to yield an imperfectly double-stranded miRNA of about 21 to 23 nucleotides. At this stage the double-stranded miRNA has protruding single-stranded 3' ends of 2-3 nt. 5. Incorporation into RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) and strand selection. The double-stranded miRNA is passed to a Argonaute protein contained in the RISC loading complex. One strand, the passenger strand, will be removed and degraded; the other strand, the guide strand, will be retained and will guide the Argonaute:miRNA complex (RISC) to target mRNAs.The human genome encodes 4 Argonaute proteins (AGO1 (EIF2C1), AGO2 (EIF2C2), AGO3 (EIF2C3), AGO4 (EIF2C4)), however only AGO2 (EIF2C2) can cleave target mRNAs with perfect or nearly perfect complementarity to the guide miRNA. For complexes that contain AGO2, cleavage of the passenger strand of the double-stranded miRNA accompanies removal of the passenger strand. Complexes containing other Argonautes may use a helicase to remove the passenger strand but this is not fully known. The resulting miRNA-loaded AGO2 is predominantly located in complexes with TARBP2 or PRKRA at the cytosolic face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

This process begins with the formation of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic neuron, proceeds to the loading of glutamate into the vesicles, and concludes with the release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft.The glutamate life cycle in the neuron begins with the loading of the nascent synaptic vesicles with cytosolic glutamate with the help the transporter protein, VGLUT1, located in the synaptic vesicular membrane. Glutamate loaded vesicles are formed in the cytoplasm and then transported to a site close to the plasma membrane where the vesicle is docked with the help of several proteins. One of the key players in the docking process in Munc 18, which interacts with syntaxin (in the plasma membrane), MINT (Munc18 interacting molecule), and DOC2.?These interactions along with the secondary interactions are needed for docking the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane.The docked synaptic vesicle is not ready for release until it undergoes molecular changes to prime it for fusion with the plasma membrane. Munc13 is one of the main players in the priming process. Munc 13 interacts with RIM (Rab3A interacting molecule) located in the synaptic vesicle. Munc 13 also interacts with DOC2. The precise molecular mechanisms of the interactions that result in docking versus priming are not clear and the docking and priming process have been combined in this annotation of this pathway. Once primed the synaptic vesicle is ready for release.Synaptic transmission involves an action potential that is generated in the presynaptic cell which induces the opening of voltage gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) located in the plasma membrane of the presynaptic neuron. Typically N, P/Q and R type of VGCCs are involved in the neurotransmitter release. Ca2+ influx through these channels results in the rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In the microdomain of glutamatergic synapses, the Ca2+ concentration could rise between 10-25 micro molar. Synaptotagmin, a Ca2+-binding protein located in the synaptic vesicular membrane, responds to the rise in the Ca2+ levels in the microdomain and induces a synaptic vesicle membrane curvature that favors vesicle fusion. Fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane is characterized by the formation of a trimeric trans-SNARE complex that involves VAMP2 from the synaptic vesicle membrane, and syntaxin and SNAP-25 from plasma membrane. Vesicle fusion incorporates the synaptic vesicle membrane into the plasma membrane, releasing the vesicle contents (glutamate) into the synaptic cleft. Postfusion the synaptic vesicle membrane proteins (VAMP2, Rab3A, VGLUT1, and synaptotagmin) are also found in the plasma membrane.",NA,

These can be man-made (drugs, industrial chemicals) or natural (alkaloids, toxins from plants and animals). Uptake is usually via ingestion but inhalation and transdermal routes are also common.The very nature of many chemicals that make them suitable for uptake by these routes, in other words their lipophilicty (favours fat solubility) is also the main reason organisms have developed mechanisms that convert them to hydrophilic (favours water solubility) compounds which are readily excreted via bile and urine. Otherwise, lipophilic chemicals would accumulate in the body and overwhelm defense mechanisms. This process is called biotransformation and is catalyzed by enzymes mainly in the liver of higher organisms but a number of other organs have considerable ability to process xenobiotica such as kidneys, gut and lungs. As well as xenobiotics, many endogenous compounds are commonly eliminated by this process.This mechanism?is of ancient origin and a major factor for its development in animals is plants. Most animals are plant eaters and thus are subject to a huge variety of chemical compounds which plants produce to stop themselves being eaten. This complex set of enzymes have several features which make them ideal for biotransformation;(1) metabolites of the parent chemical are usually made more water soluble so it favours rapid excretion via bile and urine(2) the enzymes possess broad and overlapping specificity to be able to deal with newly exposed chemicals(3) metabolites of the parent generally don't have adverse biological effects.In the real world however, all these criteria have exceptions. Many chemicals are transformed into reactive metabolites. In pharmacology, the metabolites of some parent drugs exert the desired pharmacological effect but in the case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which can undergo epoxidation, it results in the formation of an electrophile which can attack proteins and DNA.Metabolism of xenobiotica occurs in several steps called Phase 1 (functionalization) and Phase 2 (conjugation). To improve water solubility, a functional group is added to or exposed on the chemical in one or more steps (Phase 1) to which hydrophilic conjugating species can be added (Phase 2). Functional groups can either be electrophilic (epoxides, carbonyl groups) or nucleophilic (hydroxyls, amino and sulfhydryl groups, carboxylic groups) (see picture).Once chemicals undergo functionalization, the electrophilic or nucleophilic species can be detrimental to biological systems. Electrophiles can react with electron-rich macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA by covalent interaction whilst nucleophiles have the potential to interact with biological receptors. That's why conjugation is so important as it mops up these potentially reactive species.Many chemicals, when exposed to certain metabolizing enzymes can induce those enzymes, a process called enzyme induction. The effect of this is that these chemicals accelerate their own biotransformation and excretion. The reverse is also true where some chemicals cause enzyme inhibition. Some other factors that alter enzyme levels are sex, age and genetic predisposition. Between species, there can be considerable differences in biotransformation ability which is a problem faced by drug researchers interpreting toxicological results to humans",NA,

This system has huge catalytic versatility and a broad substrate specificity, acting upon xenobiotica and endogenous compounds. It is also called the mixed-function oxidase system, the P450 monooxygenases and the heme-thiolate protein system. All P450 enzymes are a group of heme-containing isozymes which are located on the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. They can be found in all tissues of the human body but are most concentrated in the liver. The name ""cytochrome P450"" (CYP) is derived from the spectral absorbance maximum at 450nm when carbon monoxide binds to CYP in its reduced (ferrous, Fe2+) state. The basic reaction catalyzed by CYP is mono-oxygenation, that is the transfer of one oxygen atom from molecular oxygen to a substrate. The other oxygen atom is reduced to water during the reaction with the equivalents coming from the cofactor?NADPH. The basic reaction is; RH (substrate) + O2 + NADPH + H+ = ROH (product) + H2O + NADP+The end results of this reaction can be (N-)hydroxylation, epoxidation, heteroatom (N-, S-) oxygenation, heteroatom (N-, S-, O-) dealkylation, ester cleavage, isomerization, dehydrogenation, replacement by oxygen or even reduction under anaerobic conditions.The metabolites produced from these reactions can either be mere intermediates which have relatively little reactivity towards cellular sysytems and are readily conjugated, or, they can be disruptive to cellular systems. Indeed, inert compounds need to be prepared for conjugation and thus the formation of potentially reactive metabolites is in most cases unavoidable.There are 57 human CYPs (in 18 families and 42 subfamilies), mostly concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells although many tissues have them to some extent (Nelson DR et al, 2004). CYPs are grouped into 14 families according to their sequence similarity. Generally, enzymes in the same family share 40% sequence similarity and 55% within a subfamily. Nomenclature of P450s is as follows. CYP (to represent cytochrome P450 superfamily), followed by an arabic number for the family, a capital letter for the subfamily and finally a second arabic number to denote the isoenzyme. An example is CYP1A1 which is the first enzyme in subfamily A of cytochrome P450 family 1.The majority of the enzymes are present in the CYP1-4 families. CYP1-3 are primarily concerned with xenobiotic biotransformation whereas the other CYPs deal primarily with endogenous compounds. The CYP section is structured by the typical substrate they act upon. Of the 57 human CYPs, 7 encode mitochondrial enzymes, all involved in sterol biosynthesis. Of the remaining 50 microsomal enzymes, 20 act upon endogenous compounds, 15 on xenobiotics and 15 are the so-called ""orphan enzymes"" with no substrate identified.The P450 catalytic cycle (picture) shows the steps involved when a substrate binds to the enzyme.(1) The normal state of a P450 with the iron in its ferric [Fe3+] state.(2) The substrate binds to the enzyme.(3) The enzyme is reduced to the ferrous [Fe2+] state by the addition of an electron from NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. The bound substrate facilitates this process.(4,5) Molecular oxygen binds and forms an Fe2+OOH complex with the addition of a proton and a second donation of an electron from either NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase or cytochrome b5. A second proton cleaves the Fe2+OOH complex to form water.(6) An unstable [FeO]3+ complex donates its oxygen to the substrate (7). The oxidised substrate is released and the enzyme returns to its initial state (1).",NA,

Originally the definition applied only to heritability across generations but later also encompassed the heritable changes that occur during cellular differentiation within one organism. Molecular analysis shows epigenetic changes comprise covalent modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, to DNA and histones. RNA interference has been implicated in the initiation of some epigenetic changes, for example transcriptional silencing of transposons. Proteins which bind to the modified DNA and histones are then responsible for repressing transcription and for maintaining the epigenetic modifications during cell division.During differentiation, patterns of gene expression are established by polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2. PRC2 methylates histones and DNA to produce the initial marks?of repression: trimethylated lysine-27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) and 5-methylcytosine in DNA. PRC2, through its component EZH2 or, in some complexes, EZH1 trimethylates lysine-27 of histone H3. The H3K27me3 produced by PRC2 is bound by the Polycomb subunit of PRC1. PRC1 ubiquitinates histone H2A and maintains repression.PRC2 and other epigenetic systems modulate gene expression through DNA methyation, the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the 5 position of cytosine in DNA by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs): DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.In the reverse process TET1,2,3 and TDG demethylate DNA through the oxidation of the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine by TET enzymes and the excision of the oxidized product (5-formylcytosine or 5-carboxylcytosine) by TDG.Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are activated and deactivated according to the metabolic requirements of the cell. Positive epigenetic regulation of rRNA expression occurs through chromatin modifications produced by activators such as ERCC6 (CSB), the B-WICH complex, and histone acetylases such as KAT2B (PCAF). Negative epigenetic regulation of rRNA expression occurs through chromatin modifications produced by repressors such as the eNoSC complex, SIRT1, and the NoRC complex.",NA,

Kadonaga, 2004, Maston, 2006, Barolo, 2002; Roeder, 2005, Rosenfeld, 2006). Of the three major classes of DNA polymerase involved in eukaryotic gene transcription, Polymerase II generally regulates protein-encoding genes. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the various components involved in cell-specific regulation of Pol-II gene transcription. Core Promoter: Pol II-regulated genes typically have a Core Promoter where Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs: i: the TATA box (TATA DNA sequence), which is bound by the ""TATA-binding protein"" (TBP). ii: the Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind, is present in many Pol II-regulated genes.?iii: the Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors bind. The core promoter binding factors are generally ubiquitously expressed, although there are exceptions to this.Proximal Promoter: immediately upstream (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region that spans up to 500 base pairs (b.p.), or even to 1000 b.p.. This region contains a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins. These TA and TR factors are generally cell- or tissue-specific in expression, rather than ubiquitous, so that the presence of their cognate binding sites in the proximal promoter region programs cell- or tissue-specific expression of the target gene, perhaps in conjunction with TA and TR complexes bound in distal enhancer regions. Distal Enhancer(s): many or most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or tissue-specific pattern. Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site. Enhancers generally have three defining characteristics: i: They can be located very long distances from the promoter of the target gene they regulate, sometimes as far as 100 Kb, or more. ii: They can be either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the target gene, including within introns of that gene. iii: They can function in either orientation in the DNA.Combinatorial mechanisms of transcription regulation: The specific combination of TA and TR binding sites within the proximal promoter and/or distal enhancer(s) provides a ""combinatorial transcription code"" that mediates cell- or tissue-specific expression of the associated target gene. Each promoter or enhancer region mediates expression in a specific subset of the overall expression pattern. In at least some cases, each enhancer region functions completely independently of the others, so that the overall expression pattern is a linear combination of the expression patterns of each of the enhancer modules.Co-Activator and Co-Repressor Complexes: DNA-bound TA and TR proteins typically recruit the assembly of specific Co-Activator (Co-A) and Co-Repressor (Co-R) Complexes, respectively, which are essential for regulating target gene transcription. Both Co-A's and Co-R's are multi-protein complexes that contain several specific protein components.Co-Activator complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) enzymatic activity. This functions to acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors, which typically increases that transcription activation of the target gene. By contrast, Co-Repressor complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone De-Acetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity. This functions to de-acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors. This typically increases the transcription repression of the target gene.Adaptor (Mediator) complexes: In addition to the co-activator complexes that assemble on particular cell-specific TA factors, - there are at least two additional transcriptional co-activator complexes common to most cells. One of these is the Mediator complex, which functions as an ""adaptor"" complex that bridges between the tissue-specific co-activator complexes assembled in the proximal promoter (or distal enhancers). The human Mediator complex has been shown to contain at least 19 protein distinct components. Different combinations of these co-activator proteins are also found to be components of specific transcription Co-Activator complexes, such as the DRIP, TRAP and ARC complexes described below. TBP/TAF complex: Another large Co-A complex is the ""TBP-associated factors"" (TAFs) that assemble on TBP (TATA-Binding Protein), which is bound to the TATA box present in many promoters. There are at least 23 human TAF proteins that have been identified. Many of these are ubiquitously expressed, but TAFs can also be expressed in a cell or tissue-specific pattern. Specific Coactivator Complexes for DNA-binding Transcription Factors. A number of specific co-activator complexes for DNA-binding transcription factors have been identified, including DRIP, TRAP, and ARC (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004, Blazek, 2005, Conaway, 2005, and Malik, 2005). The DRIP co-activator complex was originally identified and named as a specific complex associated with the Vitamin D Receptor member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (Rachez, 1998). Similarly, the TRAP co-activator complex was originally identified as a complex that associates with the thyroid receptor (Yuan, 1998). It was later determined that all of the components of the DRIP complex are also present in the TRAP complex, and the ARC complex (discussed further below). For example, the DRIP205 and TRAP220 proteins were show to be identical, as were specific pairs of the other components of these complexes (Rachez, 1999).In addition, these various transcription co-activator proteins identified in mammalian cells were found to be the orthologues or homologues of the Mediator (""adaptor"") complex proteins (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004). The Mediator proteins were originally identified in yeast by Kornberg and colleagues, as complexes associated with DNA polymerase (Kelleher, 1990). In higher organisms, Adapter complexes bridge between the basal transcription factors (including Pol II) and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) bound to sites within upstream Proximal Promoter regions or distal Enhancer regions (Figure 1). However, many of the Mediator homologues can also be found in complexes associated with specific transcription factors in higher organisms. A unified nomenclature system for these adapter / co-activator proteins now labels them Mediator 1 through Mediator 31 (Bourbon, 2004). For example, the DRIP205 / TRAP220 proteins are now identified as Mediator 1 (Rachez, 1999), based on homology with yeast Mediator 1. Example Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling: One well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription is selective regulation of target genes during Notch signaling. Notch signaling was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006). In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless. In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym ""CSL"" has been given to this conserved transcription factor family. There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL. In Drosophila, Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that it represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling. At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling. In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein). Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002). All three of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator complexes to mediate activation in the presence of Notch signaling. However, in mammals, there may be multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that has been observed in Drosophila. During Notch signaling in all systems, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription co-activator for CSL proteins. In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of Notch target genes in the nucleus (Figure 2). Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex. This Co-R complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of at least some Notch target genes. However, there now is evidence that still other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).

CD4+ T cells play a central role in immune protection. On their activation they stimulate differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing B-cell blasts and initiate adaptive immune responses. MHC class II molecules are transmembrane glycoprotein heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits. Newly synthesized MHC II molecules present in the endoplasmic reticulum bind to a chaperone protein called invariant (Ii) chain. The binding of Ii prevents the premature binding of self antigens to the nascent MHC molecules in the ER and also guides MHC molecules to endocytic compartments. In the acidic endosomal environment, Ii is degraded in a stepwise manner, ultimately to free the class II peptide-binding groove for loading of antigenic peptides. Exogenous?antigens are internalized by the APC by receptor mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis or pinocytosis into endocytic compartments of MHC class II positive cells, where engulfed antigens are degraded in a low pH environment by multiple acidic proteases, generating MHC class II epitopes. Antigenic peptides are then loaded into the class II ligand-binding groove. The resulting class II peptide complexes then move to the cell surface, where they are scanned by CD4+ T cells for specific recognition (Berger & Roche 2009, Zhou & Blum 2004, Watts 2004, Landsverk et al. 2009).",NA,

Once released, arachidonic acid is acted on by prostaglandin G/H synthases (PTGS, also known as cyclooxygenases (COX)) to form prostaglandins and thromboxanes, by arachidonate lipoxygenases (ALOX) to form leukotrienes, epoxygenases (cytochrome P450s and epoxide hydrolase) to form epoxides such as 15-eicosatetraenoic acids, and omega-hydrolases (cytochrome P450s) to form hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008).Levels of free arachidonic acid in the cell are normally very low so the rate of synthesis of eicosanoids is determined primarily?by the activity of phospholipase A2, which mediates phospholipid cleavage to generate free arachidonic acid.

Most ubiquinone is naturally reduced to ubiquinol (Q10H2 in humans) and it is this form which dominates in most human tissues. It functions as an ubiquitous coenzyme in redox reactions and its ability both to associate with complexes I and III of the electron transport chain and to move freely in the inner mitochondrial membrane are central to its role in electron transport. In eukaryotes ubiquinones/ubiquinols are also found in other membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicles, lysosomes and peroxisomes.Ubiquinol/ubiquinone is synthesized in the following way. Initially, the polyisoprenoid tail is assembled by a polyprenyl diphosphate synthase. Next, 4 hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase (COQ2) catalyses the formation of the covalent linkage between the benzoquinone head?group and the tail to produce 4 hydroxy 3 polyprenyl benzoic acid intermediate (DHB, 3 decaprenyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid in humans). There follows modifications of the aromatic ring starting with hydroxylation, followed by O methylation, and decarboxylation to form the 2 methoxy 6 polyprenyl phenol intermediate (DMPhOH ; 2 methoxy 6 decaprenylphenol in humans).

Once HA enters lysosomes, the acidic conditions favour hyaluronidases to cleave it into small oligosaccharides, the most common size being a tetrasaccharide. Beta-glucuronidases participate in degrading the small oligosaccharides in the lysosome. Ultimately, HA is degraded into its constituent sugars (glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine) which can be used to reform many glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) when released from the lysosome.A third of the total HA content in humans is turned over daily and it has a short half life of minutes in circulation up to days in many tissues.

TGFB1 is posttranslationally processed by furin (Dubois et al. 1995) to form a homodimer and secreted to the extracellular space as part of the large latent complex (LLC). After the LLC disassembles in the extracellular space, dimeric TGFB1 becomes capable of binding to TGFBR2 (Annes et al. 2003, Keski Oja et al. 2004). Formation of TGFB1:TGFBR2 complex creates a binding pocket for TGF-beta receptor type-1 (TGFBR1) and TGFBR1 is recruited to the complex by binding to both TGFB1 and TGFBR2. This results in an active heterotetrameric TGF-beta receptor complex that consists of TGFB1 homodimer bound to two heterodimers of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 (Wrana et al. 1992, Moustakas et al. 1993, Franzen et al. 1993). TGF-beta signaling can also occur through a single heterodimer of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, although with decreased efficiency (Huang et al. 2011).?TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 interact through their extracellular domains, which brings their cytoplasmic domains together. Ligand binding to extracellular receptor domains is cooperative, but no conformational change is seen from crystal structures of either TGFB1- or TGFB3-bound heterotetrameric receptor complexes (Groppe et al. 2008, Radaev et al. 2010).Activation of TGFBR1 by TGFBR2 in the absence of ligand is prevented by FKBP1A (FKBP12), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. FKBP1A forms a complex with inactive TGFBR1 and dissociates from it only after TGFBR1 is recruited by TGFB1-bound TGFBR2 (Chen et al. 1997). Both TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are receptor serine/threonine kinases. Formation of the hetero-tetrameric TGF-beta receptor complex (TGFBR) in response to TGFB1 binding induces receptor rotation, so that TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 cytoplasmic kinase domains face each other in a catalytically favourable configuration. TGFBR2 trans-phosphorylates serine residues at the conserved Gly-Ser-rich juxtapositioned domain (GS domain) of TGFBR1 (Wrana et al. 1994, Souchelnytskyi et al. 1996), activating TGFBR1.In addition to phosphorylation, TGFBR1 may also be sumoylated in response to TGF-beta stimulation. Sumoylation enhances TGFBR1 kinase activity (Kang et al. 2008). The activated TGFBR complex is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis into early endosomes. With the assistance of SARA, an early endosome membrane protein, phosphorylated TGFBR1 within TGFBR complex recruits SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 , i.e. R-SMADs (Tsukazaki et al. 1998). TGFBR1 phosphorylates recruited SMAD2/3 on two C-terminal serine residues (Souchelnytskyi et al. 2001). The phosphorylation changes the conformation of SMAD2/3 MH2 domain, promoting dissociation of SMAD2/3 from SARA and TGFBR1 (Souchelnytskyi et al. 1997, Macias-Silva et al. 1996, Nakao et al. 1997) and formation of SMAD2/3 trimers (Chacko et al. 2004). The phosphorylated C-terminal tail of SMAD2/3 has high affinity for SMAD4 (Co-SMAD), inducing formation of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimers, composed of two phosphorylated R-SMADs (SMAD2 and/or SMAD3) and SMAD4 (Co-SMAD). SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimers are energetically favored over R-SMAD trimers (Nakao et al. 1997, Qin et al. 2001, Kawabata et al. 1998, Chacko et al. 2004).

TGFBR1 is recruited to tight junctions by binding PARD6A, a component of tight junctions. After TGF-beta stimulation, activated TGFBR2 binds TGFBR1 at tight junctions, and phosphorylates both TGFBR1 and PARD6A. Phosphorylated PARD6A recruits SMURF1 to tight junctions.

Higher levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, however, may target SKI and SKIL for degradation (Strochein et al. 1999, Sun et al. 1999 PNAS, Bonni et al. 2001) through recruitment of SMURF2 (Bonni et al. 2001) or RNF111 i.e. Arkadia (Levy et al. 2007) ubiquitin ligases to SKI/SKIL by SMAD2/3. Therefore,the ratio of SMAD2/3 and SKI/SKIL determines the outcome: inhibition of SMAD2/3:SMAD4-mediated transcription or degradation of SKI/SKIL. SKI and SKIL are overexpressed in various cancer types and their oncogenic effect is connected with their ability to inhibit signaling by TGF-beta receptor complex. SMAD4 can be monoubiquitinated by a nuclear ubiquitin ligase TRIM33 (Ecto, Ectodermin, Tif1-gamma). Monoubiquitination of SMAD4 disrupts SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimers and leads to SMAD4 translocation to the cytosol. In the cytosol, SMAD4 can be deubiquitinated by USP9X (FAM), reversing TRIM33-mediated negative regulation (Dupont et al. 2009).Phosphorylation of the linker region of SMAD2 and SMAD3 by CDK8 or CDK9 primes SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex for ubiquitination by NEDD4L and SMURF ubiquitin ligases. NEDD4L ubiquitinates SMAD2/3 and targets SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer for degradation (Gao et al. 2009). SMURF2 monoubiquitinates SMAD2/3, leading to disruption of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complexes (Tang et al. 2011).

Although cone photoreceptors make up around 5% of all photoreceptor cells and are outnumbered 20 to 1 by rod photoreceptors, they mediate daylight vision in the human eye whereas rods mediate twilight vision. Also, cones are around 100-times less light-sensitive than rods thereby depriving us of colour vision in dark conditions in which cones cannot function. Rod function saturates in even moderate amounts of light whereas cones can adjust to even very bright light conditions, a process called light adaptation. In bright conditions, rods can take up to one hour to regain their sensitivity whereas cones can recover in a few minutes, a process called dark adaptation and which allows us to retain visual perception in changing light conditions.Cone cells express three types of opsin which allow colour discrimination. Long Wavelength Sensitive Opsin (OPN1LW) detects red , Short?Wavelength Sensitive Opsin (OPN1SW) detects blue, and Medium Wavelength Sensitive Opsin (OPN1MW) detects green regions of the light spectrum.In the canonical retinoid (visual) cycle, the visual chromophore is regenerated in reactions involving the rod outer segments (ROS) and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). For cones, chromophore recycling is independent of the RPE and instead involves Muller cells in the retina which supply the chromophore selectively to cones. The molecular steps of the cone retinoid (visual) cycle are outlined in this section. The ability of cones to react to bright and differing light conditions means it has to regenerate the chromophore much quicker than rods. All-trans-retinol (atROL) released from cone outer segments is taken up by Muller cells where it is directly isomerized back to 11-cis-retinol (11cROL) then esterified by LRAT. When required, these 11-cis-retinyl esters can be hydrolysed by 11-cis-RE hydrolases back to 11cROL then oxidised in the cone photoreceptor cell to regenerate 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL), the visual chromophore (see reviews von Lintig 2012, Wang & Kefalov 2011, Kefalov 2012, Wolf 2004).",NA,

The events in this process are photochemical, biochemical and electrophysiological and are highly conserved across many species. This process occurs in two types of photoreceptors in the retina, rods and cones. Each type consists of two parts, the outer segment which detects a photon signal and the inner segment which contains the necessary machinery for cell metabolism. Each type of cell functions differently. Rods are very light sensitive but their flash response is slow so they work best in twilight conditions but are not good at detecting objects moving quickly. Cones are less light-sensitive and have a fast flash response so they work best in daylight conditions and are better at detecting fast moving objects than rods.The visual pigment consists of a chromophore (11-cis-retinal, 11cRAL, A1) covalently attached to a GPCR?opsin family member. The linkage is via a Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. Upon photon absorption, 11cRAL isomerises to all-trans retinal (atRAL), changing the conformation of opsin to an activated form which can activate the regulatory G protein transducin (Gt). The alpha subunit of Gt activates phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to 5'-GMP. As high level of cGMP keep cGMP-gated sodium channels open, the lowering of cGMP levels closes these channels which causes hyperpolarization of the cell and subsequently, closure of voltage-gated calcium channels. As calcium levels drop, the level of the neurotransmitter glutamate also drops causing depolarization of the cell. This effectively relays the light signal to postsynaptic neurons as electrical signal (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012, Pugh & Lamb 1993).11cRAL cannot be synthesised in vertebrates. Vitamin A from many dietary sources is the precursor for 11cRAL. It is taken from food in the form of esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate or one of four caretenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin). Retinoids are transported from the gut to be stored in liver, until required by target organs such as the eye (Harrison & Hussain 2001, Harrison 2005). In the eye, in the form 11cRAL, it is used in the retinoid (visual) cycle to initiate phototransduction and for visual pigment regeneration to ready the photoreceptor for the next phototransduction event (von Lintig 2012, Blomhoff & Blomhoff 2006, von Lintig et al. 2010, D'Ambrosio et al. 2011, Wang & Kefalov 2011, Kefalov 2012, Wolf 2004).",NA,

In the absence of activating signals, the regulatory subunit stabilizes the catalytic subunit while inhibiting its activity. The complex becomes activated when extracellular signals stimulate the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors or receptor-associated proteins. The p85 regulatory subunit binds phosphorylated motifs of activator proteins, which induces a conformational change that relieves p85-mediated inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit and enables PI3K to phosphorylate PIP2 to form PIP3. The phosphoinositide kinase activity of PI3K is opposed by the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN. PIP3 acts as a messenger that recruits PDPK1 (PDK1) and AKT (AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3) to the plasma membrane. PDPK1 also possesses a low affinity for PIP2, so small amounts of PDPK1 are always present?at the membrane. Binding of AKT to PIP3 induces a conformational change that enables TORC2 complex to phosphorylate AKT at a conserved serine residue (S473 in AKT1). Phosphorylation at the serine residue enables AKT to bind to PDPK1 and exposes a conserved threonine residue (T308) that is phosphorylated by PDPK1. AKT phosphorylated at both serine and threonine residues dissociates from the plasma membrane and acts as a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear targets involved in regulation of cell metabolism, survival and gene expression. For a recent review, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007. Signaling by PI3K/AKT is frequently constitutively activated in cancer. This activation can be via gain-of-function mutations in PI3KCA (encoding catalytic subunit p110alpha), PIK3R1 (encoding regulatory subunit p85alpha) and AKT1. The PI3K/AKT pathway can also be constitutively activated by loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN. Gain-of-function mutations activate PI3K signaling by diverse mechanisms. Mutations affecting the helical domain of PIK3CA and mutations affecting nSH2 and iSH2 domains of PIK3R1 impair inhibitory interactions between these two subunits while preserving their association. Mutations in the catalytic domain of PIK3CA enable the kinase to achieve an active conformation. PI3K complexes with gain-of-function mutations therefore produce PIP3 and activate downstream AKT in the absence of growth factors (Huang et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2005, Miled et al. 2007, Horn et al. 2008, Sun et al. 2010, Jaiswal et al. 2009, Zhao and Vogt 2010, Urick et al. 2011). While AKT1 gene copy number, expression level and phosphorylation are often increased in cancer, only one low frequency point mutation has been repeatedly reported in cancer and functionally studied. This mutation represents a substitution of a glutamic acid residue with lysine at position 17 of AKT1, and acts by enabling AKT1 to bind PIP2. PIP2-bound AKT1 is phosphorylated by TORC2 complex and by PDPK1 that is always present at the plasma membrane, due to low affinity for PIP2. Therefore, E17K substitution abrogates the need for PI3K in AKT1 activation (Carpten et al. 2007, Landgraf et al. 2008). Loss-of-function mutations affecting the phosphatase domain of PTEN are frequently found in sporadic cancers (Kong et al. 1997, Lee et al. 1999, Han et al. 2000), as well as in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS) (Marsh et al. 1998). PTEN can also be inactivated by gene deletion or epigenetic silencing, or indirectly by overexpression of microRNAs that target PTEN mRNA (Huse et al. 2009). Cells with deficient PTEN function have increased levels of PIP3, and therefore increased AKT activity. For a recent review, please refer to Hollander et al. 2011. Because of their clear involvement in human cancers, PI3K and AKT are targets of considerable interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors. Although none of the currently available inhibitors display preference for mutant variants of PIK3CA or AKT, several inhibitors targeting the wild-type kinases are undergoing clinical trials. These include dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, class I PI3K inhibitors, pan-PI3K inhibitors, and pan-AKT inhibitors. While none have yet been approved for clinical use, these agents show promise for future therapeutics. In addition, isoform-specific PI3K and AKT inhibitors are currently being developed, and may provide more specific treatments along with reduced side-effects.

These depend on the oxidative deamination of specific lysine or hydroxylysine residues in the telopeptide region by lysyl oxidase (LOX) with the subsequent spontaneous formation of covalent intermolecular cross-links (Pinnell & Martin 1968, Siegel et al. 1970, 1974, Maki 2009, Nishioka et al. 2012). Hydroxylysine is formed intracellularly by lysine hydroxylases (LH). There are different forms of LH responsible for hydroxylation of helical and telopeptide lysines (Royce & Barnes 1985, Knott et al.1997, Takaluoma et al. 2007, Myllyla 2007). The chemistry of the cross-links formed depends on whether lysines or hydroxylysines are present in the telopeptides (Barnes et al. 1974), which depends on the proportion of collagen lysines post-translationally converted to hydroxylysine by LH. The lysine pathway predominates in adult?skin, cornea and sclera while the hydroxylysine pathway occurs primarily in bone, cartilage, ligament, tendons, embryonic skin and most connective tissues (Eyre 1987, Eyre & Wu 2005, Eyre et al. 2008). Oxidative deamination of lysine or hydroxylysine residues by LOX generates the allysine and hydroxyallysine aldehydes respectively. These can spontaneously react with either another aldehyde to form an aldol condensation product (intramolecular cross-link), or with an unmodified lysine or hydroxylysine residue to form intermolecular cross-links.The pathway of cross-linking is regulated primarily by the hydroxylation pattern of telopeptide and triple-helix domain lysine residues. When lysine residues are the source of aldehydes formed by lysyl oxidase the allysine cross-linking pathway leads to the formation of aldimine cross-links (Eyre & Wu 2005). These are stable at physiological conditions but readily cleaved at acid pH or elevated temperature. When hydroxylysine residues are the source of aldehydes formed by lysyl oxidase the hydroxyallysine cross-linking pathway leads to the formation of more stable ketoimine cross-links. Telopeptide lysine residues can be converted by LOX to allysine, which can react with a helical hydroxylysine residue forming the lysine aldehyde aldimine cross-link dehydro hydroxylysino norleucine (deHHLNL) (Bailey & Peach 1968, Eyre et al. 2008). If the telopeptide residue is hydroxylysine, the hydroxyallysine formed by LOX can react with a helical hydroxylysine forming the Schiff base, which spontaneously undergoes an Amadori rearrangement resulting in the ketoimine cross link hydroxylysino 5 ketonorleucine (HLKNL). This stable cross-link is formed in tissues where telopeptide residues are predominanly hydroxylated, such as foetal bone and cartilage, accounting for the relative insolubility of collagen from these tissues (Bailey et al. 1998). In bone, telopeptide hydroxyallysines can react with the epsilon-amino group of a helical lysine (Robins & Bailey 1975). The resulting Schiff base undergoes Amadori rearrangement to form lysino-hydroxynorleucine (LHNL). An alternative mechanism of maturation of ketoimine cross-links has been reported in cartilage leading to the formation of arginoline (Eyre et al. 2010). These divalent crosslinks greatly diminish as connective tissues mature, due to further spontaneous reactions (Bailey & Shimokomaki 1971, Robins & Bailey 1973) with neighbouring peptides that result in tri- and tetrafunctional cross-links. In mature tissues collagen cross-links are predominantly trivalent. The most common are pyridinoline or 3-hydroxypyridinium cross-links, namely hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline (HL-Pyr) and lysyl-pyridinoline (L-Pyr) cross-links (Eyre 1987, Ogawa et al. 1982, Fujimoto et al. 1978). HL-Pyr is formed from three hydroxylysine residues, HLKNL plus a further hydroxyallysine. It predominates in highly hydroxylated collagens such as type II collagen in cartilage. L-Pyr is formed from two hydroxylysines and a lysine, LKNL plus a further hydroxyallysine, found mostly in calcified tissues (Bailey et al. 1998). Trivalent collagen cross-links can also form as pyrroles, either Lysyl-Pyrrole (L-Pyrrole) or hydroxylysyl-pyrrole (HL-Pyrrole), respectively formed when LKNL or HLKNL react with allysine (Scott et al. 1981, Kuypers et al. 1992). A further three-way crosslink can form when DeH-HLNL reacts with histidine to form histidino-hydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL), found in skin and cornea (Yamauchi et al. 1987, 1996). This can react with an additional lysine to form the tetrafunctional cross-link histidinohydroxymerodesmosine (Reiser et al. 1992, Yamauchi et al. 1996). Another mechanism which could be involved in the cross-linking of collagen IV networks is the sulfilimine bond (Vanacore et al. 2009), catalyzed by peroxidasin, an enzyme found in basement membrane (Bhave 2012).To improve clarity inter-chain cross-linking is represented here for Collagen type I only. Although the formation of each type of cross-link is represented here as an independent event, the partial and random nature of lysine hydroxylation and subsequent lysyl oxidation means that any combination of these cross-linking events could occur within the same collagen fibril .",NA,

They also play important roles in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. Activation through FCERI-bound antigen-specific IgE causes release of potent inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteases, chemotactic factors, cytokines and metabolites of arachidonic acid that act on the vasculature, smooth muscle, connective tissue, mucous glands and inflammatory cells (Borish & Joseph 1992, Amin 2012, Metcalfe et al. 1993). FCERI is a multimeric cell-surface receptor that binds the Fc fragment of IgE with high affinity. On mast cells and basophils FCERI exists as a tetrameric complex consisting of one alpha-chain, one beta-chain, and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains, and on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and eosinophils it exists as a trimeric complex with one alpha-chain and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains (Wu?2011, Kraft & Kinet 2007). FCERI signaling in mast cells includes a network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins. These molecules coordinate ultimately leading to effects on degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine and chemokine production and cell migration and adhesion, growth and survival.The first step in FCERI signaling is the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of both the beta and the gamma subunits of the FCERI by LYN, which is bound to the FCERI beta-chain. The phosphorylated ITAM then recruits the protein tyrosine kinase SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) which then phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT. Phosphorylated LAT (linker for activation of T cells) acts as a scaffolding protein and recruits other cytosolic adaptor molecules GRB2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2), GADS (GRB2-related adaptor protein), SHC (SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing transforming protein C) and SLP76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), as well as the exchange factors and adaptor molecules VAV and SOS (son of sevenless homologue), and the signalling enzyme phospholipase C gamma1 (PLC-gamma1). Tyrosoine phosphorylation of enzymes and adaptors, including VAV, SHC GRB2 and SOS stimulate small GTPases such as RAC, RAS and RAF. These pathways lead to activation of the ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases, histamine release and cytokine production. FCERI activation also triggers the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma which upon membrane localisation hydrolyse PIP2 to form IP3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) - second messengers that release Ca2+ from internal stores and activate PKC, respectively. Degranulation or histamine release follows the activation of PLC-gamma and protein kinase C (PKC) and the increased mobilization of calcium (Ca2+). Receptor aggregation also results in the phosphorylation of adaptor protein NTAL/LAT2 which then recruits GAB2. PI3K associates with phosphorylated GAB2 and catalyses the formation of PIP3 in the membrane, which attracts many PH domain proteins like BTK, PLC-gamma, AKT and PDK. PI3K mediated activation of AKT then regulate the mast cell proliferation, development and survival (Gu et al. 2001).",NA,

At the anaphase onset, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitinates PTTG1 (securin), targeting it for degradation (Hagting et al. 2002). PTTG1 acts as an inhibitor of ESPL1 (known as separin i.e. separase). Hence, PTTG1 removal initiated by APC/C, enables ESPL1 to become catalytically active (Zou et al. 1999, Waizenegger et al. 2002). ESPL1 undergoes autoleavage (Waizenegger et al. 2002) and also cleaves RAD21 subunit of centromeric cohesin (Hauf et al. 2001). RAD21 cleavage promotes dissociation of cohesin complexes from sister centromeres, leading to separation of sister chromatids. Subsequent movement of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle segregates replicated chromosomes to two daughter cells (Waizenegger et al. 2000, Hauf et al. 2001, Waizenegger et al. 2002).",NA,

Stable binding of cohesin complexes to chromatin, measured by a mean residence time on chromatin, is triggered by DNA replication in S-phase (Gerlich et al. 2006), consistent with establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In S-phase, acetyltransferases ESCO1 and ESCO2 acetylate the SMC3 cohesin subunit (Hou and Zou 2005, Zhang et al. 2008, Nishiyama et al. 2010, Whelan et al. 2012). The acetylation of SMC3, in addition to DNA replication and the presence of PDS5 on cohesin, facilitates the recruitment of CDCA5 (Sororin) to cohesin complexes, an essential step in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in mammalian cells (Rankin et al. 2005, Nishiyama et al. 2010). CDCA5?(Sororin) displaces WAPAL from PDS5, thus preventing WAPAL to interfere with the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion (Nishiyama et al. 2010).

MII activates the G protein transducin (Gt) that in turn activates phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). Consequently, there is a fall in the intracellular concentration of cGMP that closes cGMP-dependent cation channels (CNG channels) and hyperpolarizes the rod.

CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of cohesin-bound CDCA5 (Sororin) at threonine T159 provides a docking site for PLK1, enabling PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of cohesin subunits STAG2 (SA2) and RAD21 (Hauf et al. 2005, Dreier et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2011). Further phosphorylation of CDCA5 by CDK1 results in dissociation of CDCA5 from cohesin complex, which restores the activity of WAPAL in removing STAG2-phosphorylated cohesin from chromosomal arms (Hauf et al. 2005, Gandhi et al. 2006, Kueng et al. 2006, Shintomi and Hirano 2006, Nishiyama et al. 2010, Zhang et al. 2011).

The stoichiometry of the complex is 1:1:1:1:1 (Hirano and Mitchinson 1994, Hirano et al. 1997, Kimura et al. 2001). SMC2 and SMC4 subunits, shared between condensin I and condensin II, are DNA-dependent ATPases, and condensins are able to introduce positive supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (Kimura and Hirano 1997). Protein levels of condensin subunits are constant during the cell cycle, however condensins are enriched on mitotic chromosomes. Four of the five subunits, SMC4, NCAPD2, NCAPG and NCAPH, are phosphorylated in both mitotic and interphase HeLa cells, but on different sites (Takemoto et al. 2004). CDK1 (CDC2) in complex with CCNB (cyclin B) phosphorylates NCAPD2, NCAPG and NCAPH in mitosis (Kimura et al. 1998, Kimura et al. 2001, Takemoto et al. 2006, MurphyÂ et al. 2008), but other mitotic kinases, such as PLK1 (St-Pierre et al. 2009), and other post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, may also be involved (reviewed by Bazile et al. 2010). Global proteomic analysis of human cell lines has identified N6-acetylation of lysine residues in condensin subunits SMC2, SMC4 and NCAPH (Choudhary et al. 2009). Another high throughput proteomic study showed that condensin I subunits NCAPD2 and NCAPH are phosphorylated upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR kinase (Matsuoka et al. 2007). As condensin I is cytosolic, it gains access to chromosomes only after the nuclear envelope breakdown at the start of prometaphase (Ono et al. 2004). Condensin I, activated by CDK1-mediated phosphorylation, promotes hypercondensation of chromosomes that were condensed in prophase through the action of condensin II (Hirota et al. 2004). AURKB may also regulate association of condensin I complex with chromatin (Lipp et al. 2007). Protein phosphatase PP2A acts independently of its catalytic activity to target condensin II complex to chromatin, but does not interact with condensin I (Takemoto et al. 2009). Full activation of condensin I requires dephosphorylation of sites modified by CK2 during interphase (Takemoto et al. 2006). Besides being essential for chromosome condensation in mitosis, condensin I may also contribute to cohesin removal from chromosome arms in prometaphase, but the exact mechanism is not known (Hirota et al. 2004).",NA,

The alpha subunit of Gt activates phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to 5'-GMP. A high level of cGMP keeps cGMP-gated cation channels open, so lower cGMP levels close these channels and hyperpolarize the cell. The hyperpolarization spreads passively to the synapse located at the opposite end of the rod, where it subsequently closes voltage-gated calcium channels.

Prolonged exposure to interferon-beta (IFNB, IFN-beta) also results in ROS increase (Moiseeva et al. 2006). ROS oxidize thioredoxin (TXN), which causes TXN to dissociate from the N-terminus of MAP3K5 (ASK1), enabling MAP3K5 to become catalytically active (Saitoh et al. 1998). ROS also stimulate expression of Ste20 family kinases MINK1 (MINK) and TNIK through an unknown mechanism, and MINK1 and TNIK positively regulate MAP3K5 activation (Nicke et al. 2005). MAP3K5 phosphorylates and activates MAP2K3 (MKK3) and MAP2K6 (MKK6) (Ichijo et al. 1997, Takekawa et al. 2005), which act as p38 MAPK kinases, as well as MAP2K4 (SEK1) (Ichijo et al. 1997, Matsuura et al. 2002), which, together with MAP2K7 (MKK7), acts as a JNK kinase. MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate?and activate p38 MAPK alpha (MAPK14) and beta (MAPK11) (Raingeaud et al. 1996), enabling p38 MAPKs to phosphorylate and activate MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3) (Ben-Levy et al. 1995, Clifton et al. 1996, McLaughlin et al. 1996, Sithanandam et al. 1996, Meng et al. 2002, Lukas et al. 2004, White et al. 2007), as well as MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) (New et al. 1998 and 2003, Sun et al. 2007). Phosphorylation of JNKs (MAPK8, MAPK9 and MAPK10) by MAP3K5-activated MAP2K4 (Deacon and Blank 1997, Fleming et al. 2000) allows JNKs to migrate to the nucleus (Mizukami et al. 1997) where they phosphorylate JUN. Phosphorylated JUN binds FOS phosphorylated by ERK1 or ERK2, downstream of activated RAS (Okazaki and Sagata 1995, Murphy et al. 2002), forming the activated protein 1 (AP-1) complex (FOS:JUN heterodimer) (Glover and Harrison 1995, Ainbinder et al. 1997). Activation of p38 MAPKs and JNKs downstream of MAP3K5 (ASK1) ultimately converges on transcriptional regulation of CDKN2A locus. In dividing cells, nucleosomes bound to the CDKN2A locus are trimethylated on lysine residue 28 of histone H3 (HIST1H3A) by the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), creating the H3K27Me3 (Me3K-28-HIST1H3A) mark (Bracken et al. 2007, Kotake et al. 2007). The expression of Polycomb constituents of PRC2 (Kuzmichev et al. 2002) - EZH2, EED and SUZ12 - and thereby formation of the PRC2, is positively regulated in growing cells by E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 (Weinmann et al. 2001, Bracken et al. 2003). H3K27Me3 mark serves as a docking site for the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) that contains BMI1 (PCGF4) and is therefore named PRC1.4, leading to the repression of transcription of p16INK4A and p14ARF from the CDKN2A locus, where PCR1.4 mediated repression of p14ARF transcription in humans may be context dependent (Voncken et al. 2005, Dietrich et al. 2007, Agherbi et al. 2009, Gao et al. 2012). MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3, activated downstream of the MAP3K5-p38 MAPK cascade, phosphorylate BMI1 of the PRC1.4 complex, leading to dissociation of PRC1.4 complex from the CDKN2A locus and upregulation of p14ARF transcription (Voncken et al. 2005). AP-1 transcription factor, formed as a result of MAP3K5-JNK signaling, as well as RAS signaling, binds the promoter of KDM6B (JMJD3) gene and stimulates KDM6B expression. KDM6B is a histone demethylase that removes H3K27Me3 mark i.e. demethylates lysine K28 of HIST1H3A, thereby preventing PRC1.4 binding to the CDKN2A locus and allowing transcription of p16INK4A (Agger et al. 2009, Barradas et al. 2009, Lin et al. 2012). p16INK4A inhibits phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of RB family members by CDK4 and CDK6, leading to cell cycle arrest (Serrano et al. 1993). p14ARF inhibits MDM2-mediated degradation of TP53 (p53) (Zhang et al. 1998), which also contributes to cell cycle arrest in cells undergoing oxidative stress. In addition, phosphorylation of TP53 by MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) activated downstream of MAP3K5-p38 MAPK signaling, activates TP53 and contributes to cellular senescence (Sun et al. 2007).",NA,

SASP components include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines (e.g. IL6 and IL8), growth factors (e.g. IGFBPs), shed cell surface molecules (e.g. TNF receptors) and survival factors. While the SASP exhibits a wide ranging profile, it is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger (oncogenic signalling, oxidative stress or DNA damage) or the cell type (epithelial vs. mesenchymal) (Coppe et al. 2008). However, as both oxidative stress and oncogenic signaling induce DNA damage, the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta?et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008). Interleukin-1-alpha (IL1A), a minor SASP component whose transcription is stimulated by the AP-1 (FOS:JUN) complex (Bailly et al. 1996), can cause paracrine senescence through IL1 and inflammasome signaling (Acosta et al. 2013).Here, transcriptional regulatory processes that mediate the SASP are annotated. DNA damage triggers ATM-mediated activation of TP53, resulting in the increased level of CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A-mediated inhibition of CDK2 prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the Cdh1:APC/C complex, allowing it to ubiquitinate and target for degradation EHMT1 and EHMT2 histone methyltransferases. As EHMT1 and EHMT2 methylate and silence the promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes, degradation of these methyltransferases relieves the inhibition of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Takahashi et al. 2012). In addition, oncogenic RAS signaling activates the CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) transcription factor (Nakajima et al. 1993, Lee et al. 2010), which binds promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes and stimulates their transcription (Kuilman et al. 2008, Lee et al. 2010). CEBPB also stimulates the transcription of CDKN2B (p15-INK4B), reinforcing the cell cycle arrest (Kuilman et al. 2008). CEBPB transcription factor has three isoforms, due to three alternative translation start sites. The CEBPB-1 isoform (C/EBP-beta-1) seems to be exclusively involved in growth arrest and senescence, while the CEBPB-2 (C/EBP-beta-2) isoform may promote cellular proliferation (Atwood and Sealy 2010 and 2011). IL6 signaling stimulates the transcription of CEBPB (Niehof et al. 2001), creating a positive feedback loop (Kuilman et al. 2009, Lee et al. 2010). NF-kappa-B transcription factor is also activated in senescence (Chien et al. 2011) through IL1 signaling (Jimi et al. 1996, Hartupee et al. 2008, Orjalo et al. 2009). NF-kappa-B binds IL6 and IL8 promoters and cooperates with CEBPB transcription factor in the induction of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Matsusaka et al. 1993, Acosta et al. 2008). Besides IL6 and IL8, their receptors are also upregulated in senescence (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008) and IL6 and IL8 may be master regulators of the SASP.IGFBP7 is also an SASP component that is upregulated in response to oncogenic RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling and oxidative stress, as its transcription is directly stimulated by the AP-1 (JUN:FOS) transcription factor. IGFBP7 negatively regulates RAS-RAF (BRAF)-MAPK signaling and is important for the establishment of senescence in melanocytes (Wajapeyee et al. 2008).Please refer to Young and Narita 2009 for a recent review.",NA,

Senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues (reviewed by Campisi 1997 and Lopez-Otin 2013), which may be due to an increased senescence rate and/or decrease in the rate of clearance of senescent cells. In a mouse model of accelerated aging, clearance of senescent cells delays the onset of age-related phenotypes (Baker et al. 2011).Cellular senescence can be triggered by the aberrant activation of oncogenes or loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes, and this type of senescence is known as the oncogene-induced?senescence, with RAS signaling-induced senescence being the best studied. Oxidative stress, which may or may not be caused by oncogenic RAS signaling, can also trigger senescence. Finally, the cellular senescence program can be initiated by DNA damage, which may be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress, and by telomere shortening caused by replicative exhaustion which may be due to oncogenic signaling. The senescent phenotype was first reported by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961, when they proposed replicative senescence as a mechanism responsible for the cessation of mitotic activity and morphological changes that occur in human somatic diploid cell strains as a consequence of serial passaging, preventing the continuous culture of untransformed cells-the Hayflick limit (Hayflick and Moorhead 1961). Secreted proteins that constitute the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS), include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines, growth factors, shed cell surface molecules and survival factors. The SASP profile is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger or the cell type (Coppe et al. 2008), but the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008).Senescent cells may remain viable for years, such as senescent melanocytes of moles and nevi, or they can be removed by phagocytic cells. The standard marker for immunohistochemical detection of senescent cells is senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal), a lysosomal enzyme that is not required for senescence.For reviews of this topic, please refer to Collado et al. 2007, Adams 2009, Kuilman et al. 2010.

In addition, persistent cell division fueled by oncogenic signaling leads to replicative exhaustion, manifested in critically short telomeres (Harley et al. 1990, Hastie et al. 1990). Shortened telomeres are no longer able to bind the protective shelterin complex (Smogorzewska et al. 2000, de Lange 2005) and are recognized as damaged DNA. The evolutionarily conserved MRN complex, consisting of MRE11A (MRE11), RAD50 and NBN (NBS1) subunits, binds DSBs (Lee and Paull 2005) and shortened telomeres that are no longer protected by shelterin (Wu et al. 2007). Once bound to the DNA, the MRN complex recruits and activates ATM kinase (Lee and Paull 2005, Wu et al. 2007), leading to phosphorylation of ATM targets, including TP53?(p53) (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998). TP53, phosphorylated on serine S15 by ATM, binds the CDKN1A (also known as p21, CIP1 or WAF1) promoter and induces CDKN1A transcription (El-Deiry et al. 1993, Karlseder et al. 1999). CDKN1A inhibits the activity of CDK2, leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest (Harper et al. 1993, El-Deiry et al. 1993).SMURF2 is upregulated in response to telomere attrition in human fibroblasts and induces senecscent phenotype through RB1 and TP53, independently of its role in TGF-beta-1 signaling (Zhang and Cohen 2004).

Centrosomic AURKA (Aurora A kinase), catalytically activated through AJUBA facilitated autophosphorylation on threonine residue T288 at G2/M transition (Hirota et al. 2003), activates PLK1 on centrosomes by phosphorylating threonine residue T210 of PLK1, critical for PLK1 activity (Jang et al. 2002), in the presence of BORA (Macurek et al. 2008, Seki et al. 2008). Once activated, PLK1 phosphorylates BORA and targets it for ubiquitination mediated degradation by SCF-beta-TrCP ubiquitin ligases. Degradation of BORA is thought to allow PLK1 to interact with other substrates (Seki, Coppinger, Du et al. 2008, Seki et al. 2008).The interaction of PLK1 with OPTN (optineurin) provides a negative-feedback mechanism for regulation of PLK1 activity. Phosphorylated PLK1 binds and phosphorylates OPTN associated with the Golgi membrane GTPase RAB8, promoting?dissociation of OPTN from Golgi and translocation of OPTN to the nucleus. Phosphorylated OPTN facilitates the mitotic phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase subunit PPP1R12A (MYPT1) and myosin phosphatase activation (Kachaner et al. 2012). The myosin phosphatase complex dephosphorylates threonine residue T210 of PLK1 and inactivates PLK1 (Yamashiro et al. 2008).",NA,

This translocation, present in only a small percentage of T-ALL patients, results in the overexpression of a truncated NOTCH1 receptor, which lacks almost the entire extracellular domain, in T lymphocytes. Oncogenic NOTCH1 mutations were subsequently found to be present in >50% of T-ALL patients, with hotspots in the heterodimerization domain (HD domain) and PEST domain of NOTCH1 (Weng et al. 2004). Normal NOTCH1 becomes activated by binding DLL (DLL1 or DLL4) or JAG (JAG1 or JAG2) ligands expressed on the surface of a neighboring cell, which leads to proteolytic cleavage of NOTCH1 by ADAM10/17 and gamma-secretase, and release of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) which regulates expression of genes that play important roles in the development of T lymphocytes (Washburn et al. 1997. Radtke et al.?1999, Maillard et al. 2004, Sambandam et al. 2005, Tan et al. 2005). Mutations in the HD domain, responsible for association of NOTCH1 extracellular and transmembrane regions after furin-mediated cleavage of NOTCH1 precursor, as well as the truncation of the NOTCH1 extracellular domain by the rare T-ALL translocation, enable constitutive production of NICD1, in the absence of ligand binding (Malecki et al. 2006, Ellisen et al. 1991).Mutations in the NOTCH1 PEST domain interfere with FBXW7 (FBW7)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of NICD1, resulting in prolonged half-life and increased transcriptional activity of NICD1, which promotes growth and division of T-lymphocytes (Weng et al. 2004, Thompson et al. 2007, O'Neil et al. 2007).Mutations in the HD domain and PEST domain of NOTCH1 are frequently found in cis in T-ALL. While HD mutations alone result in up to ~10-fold increase in NOTCH1 transcriptional activity and PEST domain mutations alone result in up to ~2-fold increase in NOTCH1 transcriptional activity, in cis mutations of HD and PEST domains act synergistically, increasing NOTCH1 transcriptional activity up to ~40-fold (Weng et al. 2004).FBXW7 (FBW7), a component of the SCF (SKP1, CUL1, and F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex SCF-FBW7 involved in the degradation of NOTCH1 (Oberg et al. 2001, Wu et al. 2001, Fryer et al. 2004), is subject to loss of function mutations in T-ALL (Akhoondi et al. 2007, Thompson et al. 2007, O'Neil et al. 2007) which are mutually exclusive with NOTCH1 PEST domain mutations (Thompson et al. 2007, O'Neil et al. 2007).Although gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are successfully used in vitro to inhibit NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL cell lines, the gamma-secretase complex has many other substrates besides NOTCH. The specificity of GSIs is therefore limited and, as they are not considered to be particularly promising drugs for the clinical treatment of T-ALL (reviewed by Purow, 2012), they have not been annotated.For a recent review of NOTCH1 signaling in cancer, please refer to Grabher et al. 2006.",NA,

The transcription factors interact with each other at the promoters of the insulin gene and act synergistically to promote transcription. Expression of the transcription factors is upregulated in response to glucose.The preproinsulin mRNA is translated by ribosomes at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the preproinsulin enters the secretion pathway by virtue of its signal peptide, which is cleaved during translation to yield proinsulin. Evidence indicates that the preproinsulin mRNA is stabilized?by glucose.In the process annotated in detail here, within the ER, three intramolecular disulfide bonds form between cysteine residues in the proinsulin. Formation of the bonds is the spontaneous result of the conformation of proinsulin and the oxidizing environment of the ER, which is maintained by Ero1-like alphaThe cystine bonded proinsulin then moves via vesicles from the ER to the Golgi Complex. High concentrations of zinc are maintained in the Golgi by zinc transporters ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7 and the proinsulin forms complexes with zinc and calcium.Proinsulin-zinc-calcium complexes bud in vesicles from the trans-Golgi to form immature secretory vesicles (secretory granules) in the cytosol. Within the immature granules the endoproteases Prohormone Convertase 1/3 and Prohormone Convertase 2 cleave at two sites of the proinsulin and Carboxypeptidase E removes a further 4 amino acid residues to yield the cystine-bonded A and B chains of mature insulin and the C peptide, which will also be secreted with the insulin. The insulin-zinc-calcium complexes form insoluble crystals within the granuleThe insulin-containing secretory granules are then translocated across the cytosol to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Translocation occurs initially by attachment of the granules to Kinesin-1, which motors along microtubules, and then by attachment to Myosin Va, which motors along the microfilaments of the cortical actin network.A pancreatic beta cell contains about 10000 insulin granules of which about 1000 are docked at the plasma membrane and 50 are readily releasable in immediate response to stimulation by glucose or other secretogogues. Docking is due to interaction between the Exocyst proteins EXOC3 on the granule membrane and EXOC4 on the plasma membrane. Exocytosis is accomplished by interaction between SNARE-type proteins Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane and Synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 on the granule membrane. Exocytosis is a calcium-dependent process due to interaction of the calcium-binding membrane protein Synaptotagmin V/IX with the SNARE-type proteins.",NA,

The ability of a cell to migrate to its correct destination depends heavily on signaling at the cell membrane. Erythropoietin producing hepatocellular carcinoma (EPH) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins (EPH receptors interacting proteins, EFNs), orchestrates the precise control necessary to guide a cell to its destination. They are expressed in all tissues of a developing embryo and are involved in multiple developmental processes such as axon guidance, cardiovascular and skeletal development and tissue patterning. In addition, EPH receptors and EFNs are expressed in developing and mature synapses in the nervous system, where they may have a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Activation of EPHB receptors in neurons induces the rapid formation and enlargement of dendritic spines, as well as rapid synapse maturation?(Dalva et al. 2007). On the other hand, EPHA4 activation leads to dendritic spine elimination (Murai et al. 2003, Fu et al. 2007).EPH receptors are the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), with fourteen total receptors divided into either A- or B-subclasses: EPHA (1-8 and 10) and EPHB (1-4 and 6). EPH receptors can have overlapping functions, and loss of one receptor can be partially compensated for by another EPH receptor that has similar expression pattern and ligand-binding specificities. EPH receptors have an N-terminal extracellular domain through which they bind to ephrin ligands, a short transmembrane domain, and an intracellular cytoplasmic signaling structure containing a canonical tyrosine kinase catalytic domain as well as other protein interaction sites. Ephrins are also sub-divided into an A-subclass (A1-A5), which are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and a B-subclass (B1-B3), members of which have a transmembrane domain and a short, highly conserved cytoplasmic tail lacking endogenous catalytic activity. The interaction between EPH receptors and its ligands requires cell-cell interaction since both molecules are membrane-bound. Close contact between EPH receptors and EFNs is required for signaling to occur. EPH/EFN-initiated signaling occurs bi-directionally into either EPH- or EFN-expressing cells or axons. Signaling into the EPH receptor-expressing cell is referred as the forward signal and signaling into the EFN-expressing cell, the reverse signal.

Depending on the circumstances, NTAL appears to have a dual role as positive and negative regulator of MC responses elicited via FCERI. Studies conducted in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) of mice lacking NTAL displayed enhanced FCERI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, calcium response, degranulation, and cytokine production. This indicated that NTAL negatively regulates FCERI-mediated degranulation.

Elevation of intracellular calcium is achieved by activation of PLC-gamma. Mast cells express both PLC-gamma1 and PLC-gamma2 isoforms and activation of these enzymes leads to conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The production of IP3 leads to mobilization of intracellular Ca+2, which later results in a sustained Ca+2 flux response that is maintained by an influx of extracellular Ca+2. In addition to degranulation, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration also activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the nuclear factor for T cell activation (NFAT) which exposes nuclear-localization signal sequence triggering translocation of the dephosphorylated NFAT-CaN complex to the nucleus.

Conjugated SUMO can act as a biinding site for proteins possessing SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) and can also directly affect the formation of complexes between the target protein and other proteins.Conjugated SUMOs are removed by cleavage of the isopeptide bond by processing enzymes SENP1,2,3,5.

Syndecan-1 and -3 GAG attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan core proteins form dimers (Choi et al. 2007) and at least syndecan-3 and -4 form oligomers (Asundi & Carey 1995, Shin et al. 2012). Syndecan-1 is the major syndecan of epithelial cells including vascular endothelium. Syndecan-2 is present mostly in mesenchymal, neuronal and smooth muscle cells. Syndecan-3 is the major syndecan of the nervous system, while syndecan-4 is ubiquitously expressed but at lower?levels than the other syndecans (refs in Alexopoulou et al. 2007). The core syndecan protein has three to five heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains, which interact with a variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin and several integrins. Syndecans may act as integrin coreceptors. Interactions between fibronectin and syndecans are modulated by tenascin-C. Syndecans bind a wide variety of soluble and insoluble ligands, inckluding extracellular matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases. As the cleaved ectodomains of syndecans retain the ability to bind ligands, ectodomain shedding is a mechanism for releasing soluble effectors that may compete for ligands with their cell-bound counterparts (Kainulainen et al. 1998).

In human cells the rDNA gene clusters are localized on the short arm of the five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes. The rRNA promoter has two essential and specially spaced sequences: a CORE element and an upstream control element (UCE, also called UPE). The CORE element of the human promoter overlaps with the transcription start site, extending from 20 to 45, and is required for specific initiation of transcription. The polymerase is a multisubunit complex, composed of two large subunits (the most conserved portions include the catalytic site that shares similarity with other eukaryotic and bacterial multisubunit RNA polymerases) and a number of smaller subunits. Under a number of experimental conditions the core is competent to mediate ribonucleic acid synthesis, in vivo however, it requires additional factors to select the appropriate template. In humans the RNA transcript (45S) is approximately 13,000 nucleotides long. Before leaving the nucleus as assembled ribosomal particles, the 45S rRNA is cleaved to give one copy each of the 28S rRNA, the 18S rRNA, and the 5.8S rRNA.

Proteomic analyses indicate that SUMO is conjugated to hundreds of proteins and most targets of SUMOylation are nuclear (Vertegal et al. 2006, Bruderer et al. 2011, Tatham et al. 2011, Da Silva et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2013). Within the nucleus SUMOylation targets include transcription factors (TFs), transcription cofactors (TCs), intracellular (nuclear) receptors, RNA binding proteins, RNA splicing proteins, polyadenylation proteins, chromatin organization proteins, DNA replication proteins, DNA methylation proteins, DNA damage response and repair proteins, immune response proteins, SUMOylation proteins, and ubiquitinylation proteins. Mitochondrial fission proteins are SUMOylated at the mitochondrial outer membrane.UBE2I (UBC9), the E2 activating enzyme?of the SUMO pathway, is itself also a SUMO E3 ligase. Most SUMOylation reactions will proceed with only the substrate protein and the UBE2I:SUMO thioester conjugate. The rates of some reactions are further enhanced by the action of other E3 ligases such as RANBP2. These E3 ligases catalyze SUMO transfer to substrate by one of two basic mechanisms: they interact with both the substrate and UBE2I:SUMO thus bringing them into proximity or they enhance the release of SUMO from UBE2I to the substrate.In the cell SUMO1 is mainly concentrated at the nuclear membrane and in nuclear bodies. Most SUMO1 is conjugated to RANGAP1 near the nuclear pore. SUMO2 is at least partially cytosolic and SUMO3 is located mainly in nuclear bodies. Most SUMO2 and SUMO3 is unconjugated in unstressed cells and becomes conjugated to target proteins in response to stress (Golebiowski et al. 2009). Especially notable is the requirement for recruitment of SUMO to sites of DNA damage where conjugation to targets seems to coordinate the repair process (Flotho and Melchior 2013).Several effects of SUMOylation have been described: steric interference with protein-protein interactions, interference with other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitinylation and phosphorylation, and recruitment of proteins that possess a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) (reviewed in Zhao 2007, Flotho and Melchior 2013, Jentsch and Psakhye 2013, Yang and Chiang 2013).

Phylogenetic analysis divides human KDACs into four classes (Gregoretti et al. 2004): Class I includes HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8; Class IIa includes HDAC4, 5, 7 and 9; Class IIb includes HDAC6 and 10; Class III are the sirtuins (SIRT1-7); Class IV has one member, HDAC11 (Gao et al. 2002). Class III enzymes use an NAD+ cofactor to perform deacetylation (Milne & Denu 2008, Yang & Seto 2008), the others classes use a metal-dependent mechanism (Gregoretti et al. 2004) to catalyze the hydrolysis of acetyl-L-lysine side chains in histone and non-histone proteins yielding L-lysine and acetate. X-ray crystal structures are available for four human HDACs; these structures have conserved active site residues, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism (Lombardi?et al. 2011). They require a single transition metal ion and are typically studied in vitro as Zn2+-containing enzymes, though in vivo HDAC8 exhibits increased activity when substituted with Fe2+ (Gantt et al. 2006). The structurally-related enzyme acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase (APAH) (Leipe & Landsman 1997) exhibits optimal activity with Mn2+, followed closely by Zn2+ (Sakurada et al. 1996).HDACs are often part of multi-protein transcriptional complexes that are recruited to gene promoters, regulating transcription without direct DNA binding. With the exception of HDAC8, all class I members can be catalytic subunits of multiprotein complexes (Yang & Seto 2008). HDAC1 and HDAC2 interact to form the catalytic core of several multisubunit complexes including Sin3, nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) and corepressor of REST (CoREST) complexes (Grozinger & Schreiber 2002). HDAC3 is part of the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complex or the homologous nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) (Li et al. 2000, Wen et al. 2000, Zhang et al. 2002, Yoon et al. 2003, Oberoi et al. 2011) which are involved in a wide range of processes including metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythms (Mottis et al. 2013). Class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9) shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Yang & Seto 2008, Haberland et al. 2009). The nuclear export of class IIa HDACs requires phosphorylation stimulated by calcium or other stimuli. They appear to have been evolutionarily inactivated as enzymes, having acquired a histidine substitution of the tyrosine residue in the active site of the mammalian deacetylase domain (H976 in humans) (Lahm et al. 2007, Schuetz et al. 2008). Instead they function as transcriptional corepressors for the MEF2 family of transcription factors (Yang & Gregoire 2005) .Histones are the primary substrate for most HDACs except HDAC6 which is predominantly cytoplasmic and acts on alpha-tublin (Hubbert et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2003, Boyault et al. 2007). HDACs also deacetylate proteins such as p53, E2F1, RelA, YY1, TFIIE, BCL6 and TFIIF (Glozak et al. 2005).Histone deacetylases are targeted by structurally diverse compounds known as HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) (Marks et al. 2000). These can induce cytodifferentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed cells (Marks et al. 2000, Bolden et al. 2006). Some HDIs have significant antitumor activity (Marks and Breslow 2007, Ma et al. 2009) and at least two are approved anti-cancer drugs.The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented and described here follow UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing.

To date KDMs have been demonstrated to catalyse demethylation of N-epsilon methylated lysine residues. Biochemically there are two distinct groups of N-epsilon methylated lysine demethylases with different catalytic mechanisms, both of which result in methyl group oxidation to produce formaldhyde. KDM1A, formerly known as Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1), belongs to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amino oxidase family. The KDM1A reaction mechanism requires a protonatable lysine epsilon-amine group, not available in trimethylated lysines, which consequently are not KDM1 substrates. Other KDMs belong to the Jumonji C (JmjC) -domain containing family. These are members of the Cupin superfamily of mononuclear Fe (II)-dependent oxygenases, which are characterised by the presence of a double-stranded beta-helix core fold. They require 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and molecular oxygen as co-substrates, producing, in addition to formaldehyde, succinate and carbon dioxide. This hydroxylation-based mechanism does not require a protonatable lysine epsilon-amine group and consequently JmjC-containing demethylases are able to demethylate tri-, di- and monomethylated lysines.The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented and described here follow UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing. Histone literature typically refers to coordinates of the protein after the initiating methionine has been removed. Therefore the coordinates of post-translated residues in the Reactome database and described here are frequently +1 when compared with the literature.In general, methylation at histone H3 lysine-5 (H3K4) and lysine-37 (H3K36), including di- and trimethylation at these sites, has been linked to actively transcribed genes (reviewed in Martin & Zhang 2005). In contrast, lysine-10 (H3K9) promoter methylation is considered a repressive mark for euchromatic genes and is also one of the landmark modifications associated with heterochromatin (Peters et al. 2002).The first reported JmjC-containing demethylases were KDM2A/B (JHDM1A/B, FBXL11/10). These catalyse demethylation of histone H3 lysine-37 when mono- or di-methylated (H3K36Me1/2) (Tsukada et al. 2006). They were found to contain a JmjC catalytic domain, previously implicated in chromatin-dependent functions (Clissold & Ponting 2001). Subsequently, many other JmjC enzymes have been identified and discovered to have lysine demethylase activities with distinct methylation site and state specificities. KDM3A/B (JHDM2A/B) are specific for mono or di-methylated lysine-10 on histone H3 (H3K9Me1/2) (Yamane et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2012). KDM4A-C (JMJD2A-C/JHDM3A-C) catalyse demethylation of di- or tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine-10 (H3K9Me2/3) (Cloos et al. 2006, Fodor et al. 2006), with a strong preference for Me3 (Whetstine et al. 2007). KDM4D (JMJD2D) also catalyses demethylation of H3K9Me2/3 (Whetstine et al. 2007). KDM4A-C (JHDM3A-C) can also catalyse demethylation of lysine-37 of histone H3 (H3K36Me2/3) (Klose et al. 2006). KDM5A-D (JARID1A-D) catalyses demethylation of di- or tri-methylated lysine-5 of histone H3 (H3K4Me2/3) (Christensen et al. 2007, Klose et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2007, Secombe et al. 2007, Seward et al. 2007, Iwase et al. 2007). KDM6A and KDM6B (UTX/JMJD3) catalyse demethylation of di- or tri-methylated lysine-28 of histone H3 (H3K27Me2/3) (Agger et al. 2007, Cho et al. 2007, De Santra et al. 2007, Lan et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2007).KDM7A (KIAA1718/JHDM1D) catalyses demethylation of mono- or di-methylated lysine-10 of histone H3 (H3K9Me1/2) and mono- and di-methylated lysine-28 of histone H3 (H3K27Me1/2) (Horton et al. 2010, Huang et al. 2010). PHF8 (JHDM1E) catalyses demethylation of mono- or di-methylated lysine-10 of histone H3 (H3K9Me1/2) and mono-methylated lysine-21 of histone H4 (H4K20Me1) (Loenarz et al. 2010, Horton et al. 2010, Feng et al. 2010, Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al. 2010, Fortschegger et al. 2010, Qi et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2010).

Arginine can be methylated in 3 different ways: monomethylarginine (MMA); NG,NG-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and NG,N'G-symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). The formation of MMA, ADMA and SDMA in mammalian cells is carried out by members of a family of nine protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) (Bedford & Clarke 2009). Type I, II and III PRMTs generate MMA on one of the two terminal guanidino nitrogen atoms. Subsequent generation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is catalysed by the type I enzymes PRMT1, PRMT2, PRMT3, co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), PRMT6 and PRMT8. Production of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is catalysed by the type II enzymes PRMT5 and PRMT7. On certain substrates, PRMT7 also functions as a type III enzyme, generating MMA only. PRMT9 activity has not been characterized.?No known enzyme is capable of both ADMA and SDMA modifications. Arginine methylation is regarded as highly stable; no arginine demethylases are known (Yang & Bedford 2013). Most PRMTs methylate glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) motifs in their substrates (Boffa et al. 1977). CARM1 methylates a proline-, glycine- and methionine-rich (PGM) motif (Cheng et al. 2007). PRMT5 can dimethylate arginine residues in GAR and PGM motifs (Cheng et al. 2007, Branscombe et al. 2001). PRMTs are widely expressed and are constitutively active as purified recombinant proteins. However, PRMT activity can be regulated through PTMs, association with regulatory proteins, subcellular compartmentalization and factors that affect enzyme-substrate interactions. The target sites of PRMTs are influenced by the presence of other PTMs on their substrates. The best characterized examples of this are for histones. Histone H3 lysine-19 acetylation (H3K18ac) primes the histone tail for asymmetric dimethylation at arginine-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 (An et al. 2003, Daujat et al. 2002, Yue et al. 2007). H3 lysine-10 acetylation (H3K9ac) blocks arginine-9 symmetric dimethylation (H3R8me2s) by PRMT5 (Pal et al. 2004). H4R3me2a catalyzed by PRMT1 favours subsequent acetylation of the histone H4 tail (Huang et al. 2005). At the same time histone H4 lysine-5 acetylation (H4K5ac) makes the H4R3 motif a better substrate for PRMT5 compared with PRMT1, thereby moving the balance from an activating ADMA mark to a suppressive SDMA mark at the H4R3 motif (Feng et al. 2011). Finally methylation of Histone H3 on arginine-3 (H3R2me2a) by PRMT6 blocks methylation of H3 lysine-5 by the MLL complex (H3K4me3), and vice versa, methylation of H3K4me3 prevents H3R2me2a methylation (Guccione et al. 2007, Kirmizis et al. 2007, Hyllus et al. 2007).

SENP1 and SENP2 are predominantly nucleoplasmic (Bailey and O'Hare 2004, Kim et al. 2005, Zhang et al. 2002, Hang and Dasso 2002, Itahana et al. 2006) and SENP5 is predominantly nucleolar (Di Bacco et al. 2006, Gong and Yeh 2006), therefore the processing reactions are believed to occur in the nucleus. The processed SUMO is then activated?by formation of a thioester bond with a cysteine residue of an E1 enzyme, UBA2 (SAE2) in a complex with SAE1. SUMO is then transferred from the E1 enzyme to an E2 enzyme, UBC9 (UBE2I).",NA,

This structure decreases the accessibility of DNA but also helps to protect it from damage. Access to DNA is achieved by highly regulated local chromatin decondensation. The 'building block' of chromatin is the nucleosome. This contains ~150 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer which consists of two each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 in a 1.65 left-handed superhelical turn (Luger et al. 1997, Andrews & Luger 2011).Most organisms have multiple genes encoding the major histone proteins. The replication-dependent genes for the five histone proteins are clustered together in the genome in all metazoans. Human replication-dependent histones occur in a large cluster on chromosome 6 termed HIST1, a smaller cluster HIST2 on chromosome 1q21, and a third small cluster HIST3 on chromosome 1q42 (Marzluff et al. 2002). Histone genes are named systematically according?to their cluster and location within the cluster.The 'major' histone genes are expressed primarily during the S phase of the cell cycle and code for the bulk of cellular histones. Histone variants are usually present as single-copy genes that are not restricted in their expression to S phase, contain introns and are often polyadenylated (Old & Woodland 1984). Some variants have significant differences in primary sequence and distinct biophysical characteristics that are thought to alter the properties of nucleosomes. Others localize to specific regions of the genome. Some variants can exchange with pre-existing major histones during development and differentiation, referred to as replacement histones (Kamakaka & Biggins 2005). These variants can become the predominant species in differentiated cells (Pina & Suau 1987, Wunsch et al. 1991). Histone variants may have specialized functions in regulating chromatin dynamics. The H2A histone family has the highest sequence divergence and largest number of variants. H2A.Z and H2A.XH2A are considered 'universal variants', found in almost all organisms (Talbert & Henikoff 2010). Variants differ mostly in the C-terminus, including the docking domain, implicated in interactions with the (H3-H4)x2 tetramer within the nucleosome, and in the L1 loop, which is the interaction interface of H2A-H2B dimers (Bonisch & Hake 2012). Canonical H2A proteins are expressed almost exclusively during S-phase. There are several nearly identical variants (Marzluff et al. 2002). No functional specialization of these canonical H2A isoforms has been demonstrated (Bonisch & Hake 2012). Reversible histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation regulate transcription from genomic DNA, defining the 'readability' of genes in specific tissues (Kouzarides 2007, Marmorstein & Trievel 2009, Butler et al. 2012).N.B. The coordinates of post-translational modifications represented here follow Reactome standardized naming, which includes the UniProt standard practice whereby coordinates refer to the translated protein before any further processing.

Aerobic cells have defenses that detoxify reactive oxygen species by converting them to less reactive products. Superoxide dismutases convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reviewed in Fukai and Ushio-Fukai 2011). Catalase and peroxidases then convert hydrogen peroxide to water.Humans contain 3 superoxide dismutases: SOD1 is located in the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space, SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and SOD3 is located in the extracellular region. Superoxide, a negative ion, is unable to easily cross membranes and tends to remain in?the compartment where it was produced. Hydrogen peroxide, one of the products of superoxide dismutase, is able to diffuse across membranes and pass through aquaporin channels. In most cells the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is mitochondria and, once in the cytosol, hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule to regulate redox-sensitive proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and others (reviewed in Veal and Day 2011, Ray et al. 2012). Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water by catalase, decomposed to water plus oxidized thioredoxin by peroxiredoxins, and decomposed to water plus oxidized glutathione by glutathione peroxidases (Presnell et al. 2013",NA,

Glycogen metabolism has been studied in most detail in muscle, although considerable experimental data are available concerning these reactions in liver as well. Glycogen metabolism in other tissues has not been studied as extensively, and is thought to resemble the muscle process. Glycogen synthesis involves five reactions. The first two, conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate and synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP, are shared with several other pathways. The next three reactions, the auto-catalyzed synthesis of a glucose oligomer on glycogenin, the linear extension of the glucose oligomer catalyzed by glycogen synthase, and the formation of branches catalyzed by glycogen branching enzyme, are unique to glycogen synthesis. Repetition of the last two reactions generates large,?extensively branched glycogen polymers. The catalysis of glycogenin glucosylation and oligoglucose chain extension by distinct isozymes in liver and nonhepatic tissues allows them to be regulated independently (Agius 2008; Bollen et al. 1998; Roach et al. 2012).",NA,

Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand, they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA and PRB)?with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus, whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al. 1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (Hern¨¢ndez MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC & Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90 complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity. After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto 1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators that facilitate gene transcription. Nuclear localization is essential for SHRs to transactivate their target genes, but the same receptors also possess non-genomic functions in the cytoplasm.The Reactome module describes the ATPase-driven conformational cycle of HSP90 that regulates ligand-dependent activation of SHRs.",NA,

Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007; Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperoneÂ system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002; Spriggs KA et al. 2010).The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes.",NA,

In addition to having a sequence-specific DNA binding domain, HSF1 contains a C-terminal region which is involved in activating the transcription of the target genes (Green M et al. 1995). However, the transactivating ability of the transactivation domain itself is not stress sensitive. Rather, it's controled by a regulatory domain of HSF1 (amino acids 221-310), which represses the transactivating ability under normal physiological conditions (Green M et al. 1995; Zuo J et al. 1995; Newton EM et al. 1996). The HSF1 transactivation domain can be divided into two distinct regions, activation domain 1 (AD1) and activation domain 2 (AD2) (Brown SA et al. 1998). AD1 and AD2 each contain residues that are important for both transcriptional initiation and elongation. Mutations in acidic residues in both AD1 and AD2 preferentially affect the?ability of HSF1 to stimulate transcriptional initiation, while mutations in phenylalanine residues preferentially affect stimulation of elongation (Brown SA et al. 1998). Activation of the DNA-bound but transcriptionally incompetent HSF1 is thought to occur upon stress induced HSF1 phosphorylation at several serine residues (Ding XZ et al. 1997; Holmberg CI et al. 2001; Guettouche T et al. 2005). In cells exposed to heat, acquisition of HSE DNA-binding activity was observed to precede phosphorylation of HSF1 (Cotto JJ et al. 1996; Kline MP & Morimoto RI 1997). While there is a sufficient evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of HSF1 is essential to modulate HSF1 transactiviting capacity, mechanisms behind stress stimuli and kinases/phosphatases involved have not been clearly established.",NA,

All known GPCRs share a common architecture of seven membrane-spanning helices connected by intra- and extracellular loops. The extracellular loops contain two highly-conserved cysteine residues that form disulphide bonds to stabilize the structure of the receptor. They recognize diverse messengers such as light, odorants, small molecules, hormones and neurotransmitters. Most GPCRs act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors; activated by ligand binding, they promote GDP-GTP exchange on associated heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. There are two models for GPCR-G Protein interactions: 1) ligand-GPCR binding first, then binding to G Proteins; 2) ""Pre-coupling"" of GPCRs and G Proteins?before ligand binding (review Oldham WM and Hamm HE, 2008). These in turn activate effector enzymes or ion channels. GPCRs are involved in a range of physiological roles which include the visual sense, smell, behavioural regulation, functions of the autonomic nervous system and regulation of the immune system and inflammation.GPCRs are divided into classes based on sequence homology and functional similarity. The main mammalian classes, in order of size, are the Rhodopsin-like family A, the Secretin receptor family B, and the Metabotropic glutamate/pheromone receptor family C",NA,

NCAM based signaling complexes can initiate downstream intracellular signals by at least two mechanisms: (1) activation of FGFR and (2) formation of intracellular signaling complexes by direct interaction with cytoplasmic interaction partners such as Fyn and FAK. Tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK interact with NCAM and undergo phosphorylation and this transiently activates the MAPK, ERK 1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors ELK and NFkB.

The major function of the Robo receptors is to mediate repulsion of the navigating growth cones. There are four human Robo homologues, ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3 and ROBO4. Most of the ROBOs have the similar ectodomain architecture as the cell adhesion molecules, with five Ig domains followed by three FN3 repeats, except for ROBO4. ROBO4 has two Ig and two FN3 repeats. The cytoplasmic domains of ROBO receptors are in general poorly conserved. However, there are four short conserved cytoplasmic sequence motifs, named CC0-3, that serve as binding sites for adaptor proteins. The ligands for the human ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are the three SLIT proteins SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3; all of the SLIT proteins contain a tandem of four LRR (leucine rich repeat) domains at the N-terminus, termed D1-D4, followed by six EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domains, a laminin G like domain (ALPS), three?EGF-like domains, and a C-terminal cysteine knot domain. Most SLIT proteins are cleaved within the EGF-like region by unknown proteases (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). NELL2 is a ligand for ROBO3 (Jaworski et al. 2015).SLIT protein binding modulates ROBO interactions with the cytosolic adaptors. The cytoplasmic domain of ROBO1 and ROBO2 determines the repulsive responses of these receptors. Based on the studies from both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms it has been inferred that ROBO induces growth cone repulsion by controlling cytoskeletal dynamics via either Abelson kinase (ABL) and Enabled (Ena), or RAC1 activity (reviewed by Hohenster 2008, Ypsilanti and Chedotal 2014, Blockus and Chedotal 2016). While there is some redundancy in the function of ROBO receptors, ROBO1 is implicated as the predominant receptor for axon guidance in ventral tracts, and ROBO2 is the predominant receptor for axon guidance in dorsal tracts. ROBO2 also repels neuron cell bodies from the floor plate (Kim et al. 2011).In addition to regulating axon guidance, ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors are also implicated in regulation of proliferation and transition of primary to intermediate neuronal progenitors through a poorly characterized cross-talk with NOTCH-mediated activation of HES1 transcription (Borrell et al. 2012).Thalamocortical axon extension is regulated by neuronal activity-dependent transcriptional regulation of ROBO1 transcription. Lower neuronal activity correlates with increased ROBO1 transcription, possibly mediated by the NFKB complex (Mire et al. 2012).It is suggested that the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.9 stimulates transcription of ROBO2, which is involved in regulation of motor axon exit from the vertebrate spinal code (Bravo-Ambrosio et al. 2012).Of the four ROBO proteins, ROBO4 is not involved in neuronal system development but is, instead, involved in angiogenesis. The interaction of ROBO4 with SLIT3 is involved in proliferation, motility and chemotaxis of endothelial cells, and accelerates formation of blood vessels (Zhang et al. 2009).",NA,

The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, amino acid and ATP form an aminoacyl adenylate molecule, releasing pyrophosphate. The aminoacyl adenylate remains associated with the synthetase enzyme where, in the second step it reacts with tRNA to form aminoacyl tRNA and AMP. The rapid hydrolysis of pyrophosphate makes these reactions essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (Fersht and Kaethner 1976a). Specificity of the tRNA charging reactions is achieved both by specific recognition of amino acid and tRNA substrates by the synthetase, and by an editing process in which incorrect aminoacyl adenylate molecules (e.g., valyl adenylate associated with isoleucyl tRNA synthetase) are hydrolyzed rather than conjugated to tRNAs in the second step of the reaction (Baldwin and Berg 1966a,b; Fersht and Kaethner 1976b). The tRNA synthetases can be divided into two structural classes?based on conserved amino acid sequence features (Burnbaum and Schimmel 1991).A single synthetase mediates the charging of all of the tRNA species specific for any one amino acid but, with three exceptions, glycine, lysine, and glutamine, the synthetase that catalyzes aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs is encoded by a different gene than the one that acts on mitochondrial tRNAs. Both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNA synthetase enzymes are encoded by genes in the nuclear genome.A number of tRNA synthetases are known to have functions distinct from tRNA charging (reviewed by Park et al. 2005). Additionally, mutations in several of the tRNA synthetases, often affecting protein domains that are dispensable in vitro for aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, are associated with a diverse array of neurological and other diseases (Antonellis and Green 2008; Park et al. 2008). These findings raise interest into the role of these enzymes in human development and disease.",NA,

The UPR is provoked by the accumulation of improperly folded protein in the ER during times of unusually high secretion activity. Analysis of mutants with altered UPR, however, shows that the UPR is also required for normal development and function of secretory cells.One level at which the URP operates is transcriptional and translational regulation: mobilization of ATF6, ATF6B, CREB3 factors and IRE1 leads to increased transcription of genes encoding chaperones, while mobilization of PERK (pancreatic eIF2alpha kinase, EIF2AK3) leads to phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha and global down-regulation of protein synthesis.ATF6, ATF6B, and CREB3 factors (CREB3 (LUMAN), CREB3L1 (OASIS), CREB3L2 (BBF2H7, Tisp40), CREB3L3 (CREB-H), and CREB3L4 (CREB4)) are membrane-bound transcription activators that respond to ER stress by transiting from the ER membrane?to the Golgi membrane where their transmembrane domains are cleaved, releasing their cytosolic domains to transit to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes.

During this process the preadipocytes cease to proliferate, begin to accumulate lipid droplets and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes such as hormone responsive lipogenenic and lipolytic programs. The most intensively studied model system for adipogenesis is differentiation of the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line by an induction cocktail of containing mitogens (insulin/IGF1), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), an inducer of cAMP (IBMX), and fetal serum (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Farmer 2006). More recently additional cellular models have become available to study adipogenesis that involve almost all stages of development (reviewed in Rosen and MacDougald 2006). In vivo knockout mice lacking putative adipogenic factors have also been extensively studied. Human pathways are traditionally inferred from those discovered in mouse but are now beginning to be validatedÂ in cellular models derived from human adipose progenitors (Fischer-Posovszky et al. 2008, Wdziekonski et al. 2011).Adipogenesis is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors (Yeh et al. 1995, reviewed in Farmer 2006, Gesta et al. 2007). One of the first observable events during adipocyte differentiation is a transient increase in expression of the CEBPB (CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta, C/EBPB) and CEBPD (C/EBPD) transcription factors (Cao et al. 1991, reviewed in Lane et al. 1999). This occurs prior to the accumulation of lipid droplets. However, it is the subsequent inductions of CEBPA and PPARG that are critical for morphological, biochemical and functional adipocytes.Ectopic expression of CEBPB alone is capable of inducing substantial adipocyte differentiation in fibroblasts while CEBPD has a minimal effect. CEBPB is upregulated in response to intracellular cAMP (possibly via pCREB) and serum mitogens (possibly via Krox20). CEBPD is upregulated in response to glucocorticoids. The exact mechanisms that upregulate the CEBPs are not fully known.CEBPB and CEBPD act directly on the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene by binding its promoter and activating transcription. CEBPB and CEBPD also directly activate the EBF1 gene (and possibly other EBFs) and KLF5 (Jimenez et al. 2007, Oishi 2005). The EBF1 and KLF5 proteins, in turn bind, and activate the PPARG promoter. Other hormones, such as insulin, affect PPARG expression and other transcription factors, such as ADD1/SREBP1c, bind the PPARG promoter. This is an area of ongoing research.During adipogenesis the PPARG gene is transcribed to yield 2 variants. The adipogenic variant 2 mRNA encodes 30 additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to the widely expressed variant 1 mRNA.PPARG encodes a type II nuclear hormone receptor (remains in the nucleus in the absence of ligand) that forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA). The heterodimer was initially identified as a complex regulating the aP2/FABP4 gene and named ARF6 (Tontonoz et al. 1994).The PPARG:RXRA heterodimer binds a recognition sequence that consists of two hexanucleotide motifs (DR1 motifs) separated by 1 nucleotide. Binding occurs even in the absence of ligands, such as fatty acids, that activate PPARG. In the absence of activating ligands, the PPARG:RXRA complex recruits repressors of transcription such as SMRT/NCoR2, NCoR1, and HDAC3 (Tontonoz and Spiegelman 2008).Each molecule of PPARG can bind 2 molecules of activating ligands. Although, the identity of the endogenous ligands of PPARG is unknown, exogenous activators include fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (reviewed in Berger et al. 2005, Heikkinen et al. 2007, Lemberger et al. 1996). The most potent activators of PPARG in vitro are oxidized derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids.. Upon binding activating ligands PPARG causes a rearrangement of adjacent factors: Corepressors such as SMRT/NCoR2 are lost and coactivators such as TIF2, PRIP, CBP, and p300 are recruited (Tontonoz and Spiegelman). PPARG also binds directly to the TRAP220 subunit of the TRAP/Mediator complex that recruits RNA polymerase II. Thus binding of activating ligand by PPARG causes transcription of PPARG target genes.Targets of PPARG include genes involved in differentiation (PGAR/HFARP, Perilipin, aP2/FABP4, CEBPA), fatty acid transport (LPL, FAT/CD36), carbohydrate metabolism (PEPCK-C, AQP7, GK, GLUT4 (SLC2A4)), and energy homeostasis (LEPTIN and ADIPONECTIN) (Perera et al. 2006).Within 10 days of differentiation CEBPB and CEBPD are no longer located at the PPARG promoter. Instead CEBPA is present. EBF1 and PPARG bind the CEBPA promoter and activate transcription of CEBPA, one of the key transcription factors in adipogenesis. A current hypothesis posits a self-reinforcing loop that maintains PPARG expression and the differentiated state: PPARG activates CEBPA and CEBPA activates PPARG. Additionally EBF1 (and possibly other EBFs) activates CEBPA, CEBPA activates EBF1, and EBF1 activates PPARG.",NA,

However, it has become clear that this greatly oversimplifies the complexities of GPCR signaling (Gurevich & Gurevich 2008). The beta:gamma G-protein dimer is also involved in downstream signaling (Smrcka 2008) and some receptors form metastable complexes with accessory proteins such as the arrestins. GPCRs are involved in many diverse signaling events (Kristiansen 2004), using a variety of pathways that include modulation of adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Regulator of G-protein Signalling (RGS) proteins can directly inhibit the activity of the G-alpha subunit (Soundararajan et al. 2008). The general function of the G alpha-s subunit (Gs) is to activate adenylate cyclase (Tesmer et al. 1997), which in turn produces cyclic-AMP (cAMP), leading to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (often referred to collectively as Protein Kinase A). The signal from the ligand-stimulated GPCR is amplified because the receptor can activate several Gs heterotrimers before it is inactivated. The classical signalling mechanism for G alpha-i (Gi) is inhibition of the cAMP dependent pathway through inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Dessauer et al. 2002). Decreased production of cAMP results in decreased activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. G alpha-z (Gz) is a member of the Gi family. Unlike other Gi family members it is pertussis toxin-insensitive. Gz interacts with Rap1 GTPase activating protein (RAP1GAP) to attenuate Rap1 signaling. The classic signalling route for G alpha-q (Gq) is activation of phospholipase C beta, leading to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases, GEFs, MAP kinases and many other proteins. The G-alpha-12/13 (G12/13) family is probably the least well characterized, at least in part because G12/13 coupling is more difficult to determine than for other subtypes, G12/13 is best known for involvement in the processes of cell proliferation and morphology, such as stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Interactions with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) are thought to mediate many of these processes. (Buhl et al.1995, Sugimoto et al. 2003).

A primary one is delivered by the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex after antigen recognition and additional costimulatory signals are delivered by the engagement of costimulatory receptors such as CD28. The best-characterized costimulatory pathways are mediated by a set of cosignaling molecules belonging to the CD28 superfamily, including CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, PD1 and BTLA receptors. These proteins deliver both positive and negative second signals to T-cells by interacting with B7 family ligands expressed on antigen presenting cells. Different subsets of T-cells have very different requirements for costimulation. CD28 family mediated costimulation is not required for all T-cell responses in vivo, and alternative costimulatory pathways also exist. Different receptors of the CD28 family and their ligands have different regulation of expression. CD28 is constitutively expressed on naive T cells whereas CTLA4 expression is dependent?on CD28/B7 engagement and the other receptor members ICOS, PD1 and BTLA are induced after initial T-cell stimulation. The positive signals induced by CD28 and ICOS molecules are counterbalanced by other members of the CD28 family, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA)4, programmed cell death (PD)1, and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), which dampen immune responses. The balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals is crucial to maximize protective immune responses while maintaining immunological tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. The costimulatory receptors CD28, CTLA4, ICOS and PD1 are composed of single extracellular IgV-like domains, whereas BTLA has one IgC-like domain. Receptors CTLA4, CD28 and ICOS are covalent homodimers, due to an interchain disulphide linkage. The costimulatory ligands B71, B72, B7H2, B7H1 and B7DC, have a membrane proximal IgC-like domain and a membrane distal IgV-like domain that is responsible for receptor binding and dimerization. CD28 and CTLA4 have no known intrinsic enzymatic activity.

CCT/TRiC is an example of a type II chaperonin, defined (in contrast to type I) as functioning in the absence of a cochaperonin. TriC/CCT is a multisubunit toroidal complex that forms a cylinder containing two back-to-back stacked rings enclosing a cavity where substrate folding occurs in an ATP dependent process (reviewed in Altschuler and Willison, 2008 ). CCT/TriC contains eight paralogous subunits that are conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms (Leroux and Hartl 2000; Archibald et al. 2001; Valpuesta et al. 2002). CCT-mediated folding of non-native substrate protein involves capture through hydrophobic contacts with multiple chaperonin subunits followed by transfer of the protein into the central ring cavity where it folds. Although folding is initiated within?this central cavity, only 5%-20% of proteins that are released have partitioned to the native state. The remaining portion is then recaptured by other chaperonin molecules (Cowan and Lewis 2001). This cycling process may be repeated multiple times before a target protein partitions to the native state. In the cell, binding to CCT occurs via presentation of target protein bound to upstream chaperones. During translation, the emerging polypeptide chain may be transferred from the ribosome to CCT via the chaperone Prefoldin (Vainberg et al., 1998) or the Hsp70 chaperone machinery (Melville et al., 2003).

Once the active sites of actin are exposed, the myosin complex bound to ADP can bind actin and the myosin head can pivot, pulling the thin actin and thick myosin filaments past one another. Once the?myosin head pivots, ADP is ejected, a fresh ATP can be bound and the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is channeled into kinetic energy by resetting the myosin head.

Dendritic spine morphogenesis is characterized by filopodia shortening followed by the formation of mature mushroom-shaped spines (Moeller et al. 2006). EPHBs control neuronal morphology and motility by modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. EPHBs control dendritic filopodia motility, enabling synapse formation. EPHBs exert these effects through interacting with the guanine exchange factors (GEFs) such as intersectin and kalirin.

The repulsive responses mediated by EPH receptors in the growth cone at the leading edge of extending axons and in axonal collateral branches contribute to the formation of selective neuronal connections. It is unclear how high affinity trans-cellular interactions between EPHs and ephrins are broken to convert adhesion into repulsion. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for the repulsion of EPH-EFN bearing cells: the first one involves regulated cleavage of ephrin ligands or EPH receptors by transmembrane proteases following cell-cell contact, while the second one is rapid endocytosis of whole EPH:EFN complexes during the retraction of the interacting cells?or neuronal growth cones (Egea & Klein 2007, Janes et al. 2005).

Ionotropic glutamate receptors are of three subtypes based on distinct physiologic properties and their differential binding of exogenous ligands namely NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate), AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and Kainate . The ionotropic receptors are glutamate gated ion channels that initiate signaling by influx of ions, and are comprised of subunits with distinct structures and distinguished based on their agonist binding. Even though all three types of receptors are found at the glutamatergic synapses yet they exhibit great diversity in the synaptic distribution. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are slow acting. Fast excitatory synaptic transmission is carried out through AMPA receptors. Post-synaptic transmission involves binding of the ligand?such as glutamate/AMPA to the AMPA receptor resulting in the Na influx which causes depolarization of the membrane. NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg at resting membrane potential. NMDA receptors are activated upon coincident depolarization and glutamate binding are activated following AMPA receptor activation.NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg at resting membrane potential. NMDA receptors are Ca permeable and their activity leads to increase in Ca which, leads to upregulation of AMPA receptors at the synapse which causes the long lasting excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) which forms the basis of long term potentiation (LTP). LTP is one form of synaptic plasticity wherein the strength of the synapses is enhanced by either change in the number, increase in the efficacy by phosphorylation or change in the type of receptors. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors changes the localization of the receptors, increases the single channel conductance, and increases the probability of open channel. GluR1 has four phosphorylation sites; serine 818 (S818) is phosphorylated by PKC and is necessary for LTP, serine 831 (S831) is phosphorylated by CaMKII that increases the delivery of receptors to the synapse and also increased their single channel conductance, threonine (T840) is implicated in LTP. Serine 845 (S845) is phosphorylated by PKA which regulates open channel probability. Long term depression is another form of plasticity wherein the number of AMPA receptors is diminished by either phosphorylation of GluR2 at Ser880 or dephosphorylation of GluR1 by protein phosphatase1, protein phosphatase 2A and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin).",NA,

Ca2+ is extruded by Ca2+-ATPases including plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase isoforms (SERCAs). Activation of non- excitable cells involves the agonist-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, an essential process for platelet activation.

Exocytosis is rendered calcium-dependent by Synaptotagmin V/IX, a calcium-binding membrane protein located in the membrane of the docked granule, although the exact action of Synapototagmin in response to calcium is unknown. Calcium also causes a translocation of reserve granules within the cell towards the plasma membrane for release in the second, sustained phase of secretion. Human cells contain L-type (continually reopening), P/Q-type (long burst), R-type (long burst), and T-type (short burst) calcium channels and these partly account for differences between the two phases of secretion. Other factors that distinguish the two phases are not yet fully known (Bratanova-Tochkova et al. 2002; Henquin 2000; MacDonald et al. 2005)",NA,

Growing axons have a highly motile structure at the growing tip called the growth cone, which senses the guidance cues in the environment through guidance cue receptors and responds by undergoing cytoskeletal changes that determine the direction of axon growth. Guidance cues present in the surrounding environment provide the necessary directional information for the trip. These extrinsic cues have been divided into attractive or repulsive signals that tell the growth cone where and where not to grow. Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the identification of highly conserved families of guidance molecules and their receptors that guide axons. These include netrins, Slits, semaphorins, and ephrins, and their cognate receptors, DCC and or uncoordinated-5 (UNC5), roundabouts (Robo), neuropilin and Eph. In addition, many other classes of adhesion molecules are also used by growth?cones to navigate properly which include NCAM and L1CAM.For review of axon guidance, please refer to Russel and Bashaw 2018, Chedotal 2019, Suter and Jaworski 2019).Axon guidance cues and their receptors are implicated in cancer progression (Biankin et al. 2012), where they likely contribute to cell migration and angiogenesis (reviewed by Mehlen et al. 2011)",NA,

It is a precursor to phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and to the inositol phosphates (IP), which serve as second messengers and also act as key regulators of many cell functions. Three members of the glucose transporter gene family encode inositol transporters (SLC2A13, SLC5A3 and SLC5A11) (Schneider 2015).Five human SLC13 genes encode sodium-coupled sulphate, di- and tri-carboxylate transporters typically located on the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (Pajor 2006).The SLC16A gene family encode proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) which mediate the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate, major energy sources for all cells in the body so their transport in and out of cells is crucial for cellular function (Morris & Felmlee 2008).The transport of essential metals and other nutrients?across tight membrane barriers such as the gastrointestinal tract and blood-brain barrier is mediated by metal-transporting proteins (encoded by SLC11, SLC30, SLC31, SLC39, SLC40 and SLC41). They can also regulate metals by efflux out of cells and cellular compartments to avoid toxic build-up (Bressler et al. 2007).The SLC6 gene family encodes proteins that mediate neurotransmitter uptake in the central nervous system (CSN) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thus terminating a synaptic signal. The proteins mediate transport of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, glycine, taurine, L-proline, creatine and betaine (Chen et al. 2004).Carrier-mediated urea transport allows rapid urea movement across the cell membrane, which is particularly important in the process of urinary concentration and for rapid urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues. Two carriers exist in humans, encoded by SLC14A1 and ALC14A2 (Olives et al. 1994).Choline uptake is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. SLC genes SLC5A7 and the SLC44 family encode choline transporters ((Okuda & Haga 2000, Traiffort et al. 2005).The SLC22 gene family of solute carriers function as organic cation transporters (OCTs), cation/zwitterion transporters (OCTNs) and organic anion transporters (OATs). Most of this family are polyspecific transporters. Since many of these transporters are expressed in the liver, kidney and intestine, they play an important role in drug absorption and excretion. Substrates include xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous amine compounds (Koepsell & Endou 2004)",NA,

The bicarbonate transport proteins move bicarbonate across the membrane. There are 14 genes which encode these transport proteins in mammals. Applying the Human Genome Organization's sytematic nomenclature to human genes, the bicarbonate transporters belong to the SLC4A and SLC26A families.

Eight families comprise the group that transports exclusively inorganic cations and anions across membranes : SLC4 plays a pivotal role in mediating Na+ - and/or Cl- -dependent transport of basic anions [e.g. HCO3-, (CO3)2-] in various tissues and cell types (in addition to pH regulation, specific members of this family also contribute to vectorial trans-epithelial base transport in several organ systems including the kidney, pancreas, and eye) (Pushkin A and Kurtz I, 2006); SLC8 is a group of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (SLC8A1 is involved in cardiac contractility) (Quednau BD et al, 2004); SLC24 is a group of Na+/Ca2+ or Na+/K+ exchangers (Altimimi HF and Schnetkamp PP, 2007); SLC9 comprises Na+/H+ exchanger proteins involved in the electroneutral exchange of sodium ion and protons (Orlowski J and Grinstein S, 2004); SLC12 functions as Na+, K+ and Cl- ion electroneutral?symporters (Hebert SC et al, 2004); SLC26 is the trans-epithelial multifunctional anion (e.g. sulfate, oxalate, HCO-, Cl-) exchanger family, important in cartilage development, production of thyroid hormone, sound amplification in the cochlea etc (Sindic A et al, 2007; Dorwart MR et al, 2008; Ashmore J, 2008). SLC34 is an important Type II Na+/(HPO4)2- symporter (Forster IC et al, 2006; Virkki LV et al, 2007); SLC20 was originally identified as a viral receptor, and functions as a Type III Na+/(H2PO4)- symporter (Collins JF et al, 2004; Virkki LV et al, 2007).

SMVT co-transports biotin (vitamin B7), D-Pantothoate (vitamin B5) and lipoic acid into cells with Na+ ions electrogenically.Four SLC gene families encode transporters that mediate the movement of nucleosides and free purine and pyrimidine bases across the plasma membrane. These transporters play key roles in nucleoside and nucleobase uptake for salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis, and in the cellular uptake of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancers and viral diseases (He et al. 2009).The human gene SLC33A1 encodes acetyl-CoA transporter AT1 (Kanamori et al. 1997). Acetyl-CoA is transported to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where it serves as the substrate of?acetyltransferases that O-acetylates sialyl residues of gangliosides and glycoproteins.Nucleotide sugars are used as sugar donors by glycosyltransferases to create the sugar chains for glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins, polysaccharides and glycolipids. Glycosyltransferases reside mainly in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whereas nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytosol. The human solute carrier family SLC35 encode nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs), localised on Golgi and ER membranes, which can mediate the antiport of nucleotide sugars in exchange for the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates (eg. UMP for UDP-sugars) (Handford et al. 2006).Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) can be used for energy sources and steroid hormone synthesis and regulate many cellular processes such as inflammation, blood pressure, the clotting process, blood lipid levels and the immune response. The SLC27A family encode fatty acid transporter proteins (FATPs) (Stahl 2004).The SLC gene family members SLCO1 SLCO2 and SLCO3 encode organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs).

Pumps utilize the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to power the movement of the substrates across the membrane, against their electrochemical gradient. Channels at the open state can transfer the substrates (ions or water) down their electrochemical gradient, at an extremely high efficiency (up to 108 s-1). Transporters facilitate the movement of a specific substrate either against or following their concentration gradient, at a lower speed (about 102 -104 s-1); as generally believed, conformational change of the transporter protein is involved in the transfer process.According to the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee, all human transporters can be grouped into the solute-carrier (SLC) superfamily (http://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/SLC). Currently, there are 55 SLC families in the superfamily, with a total of at least 362 putatively?functional protein-coding genes (Hediger et al. 2004, He et al. 2009; http://www.bioparadigms.org/slc/intro.htm). At least 20-25% amino-acid sequence identity is shared by members belonging to the same SLC family. No homology is shared between different SLC families. While the HUGO nomenclature system by definition only includes human genes, the nomenclature system has been informally extended to include rodent species through the use of lower cases letters (e.g., Slc1a1 denotes the rodent ortholog of the human SLC1A1 gene). And it's worthwhile to mention that pumps, channels and aquaporins are not included in SLC superfamily.To date, nine SLC gene families (SLC4, SLC5, SLC8, SLC9, SLC12, SLC20, SLC24, SLC26 and SLC34) comprise the group that exclusively transports inorganic cations and anions across membranes. A further eight SLC gene families (SLC1, SLC6, SLC7, SLC16, SLC25, SLC36, SLC38 and SLC43) are involved in the transport of amino acids and oligopeptides (He et al. 2009). Two gene families are responsible for glucose transport in humans. SLC2 (encoding GLUTs) and SLC5 (encoding SGLTs) families mediate glucose absorption in the small intestine, glucose reabsorption in the kidney, glucose uptake by the brain across the blood-brain barrier and glucose release by all cells in the body (Wood & Trayhurn 2003).SLC transporters are able to transport bile salts, organic acids, metal ions and amine compounds. Myo-Inositol is a precursor to phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and to the inositol phosphates (IP), which serve as second messengers and also act as key regulators of many cell functions (Schneider 2015). Mono-, di- and tri-carboxylate transporters mediate the transport of these acids across cellular membranes (Pajor 2006, Morris & Felmlee 2008). Essential metals are transported by metal-transporting proteins, which also control their efflux to avoid toxic build-up (Bressler et al. 2007). The SLC6 gene family encodes proteins that mediate neurotransmitter uptake in the central nervous system (CSN) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thus terminating a synaptic signal (Chen et al. 2004). Urea transport is particularly important in the process of urinary concentration and for rapid urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues (Olives et al. 1994). Choline uptake is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. SLC genes SLC5A7 and the SLC44 family encode choline transporters (Traiffort et al. 2005). The SLC22 gene family of solute carriers function as organic cation transporters (OCTs), cation/zwitterion transporters (OCTNs) and organic anion transporters (OATs). They play important roles in drug absorption and excretion.

These molecules appear to be essential components of cell membranes, and intermediates in the pathways of sphingolipid synthesis and breakdown modulate processes including apoptosis and T cell trafficking.While sphingolipids are abundant in a wide variety of foodstuffs, these dietary molecules are mostly degraded by the intestinal flora and intestinal enzymes. The body primarily depends on de novo synthesis for its sphingolipid supply (Hannun and Obeid 2008; Merrill 2002). De novo synthesis proceeds in four steps: the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA?and serine to form 3-ketosphinganine, the reduction of 3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine, the acylation of sphinganine with a long-chain fatty acyl CoA to form dihydroceramide, and the desaturation of dihydroceramide to form ceramide.Other sphingolipids involved in signaling are derived from ceramide and its biosynthetic intermediates. These include sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) 1-phosphate, phytoceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate.Sphingomyelin is synthesized in a single step in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus from ceramides generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and transferred to the Golgi by CERT (ceramide transfer protein), an isoform of COL4A3BP that is associated with the ER membrane as a complex with PPM1L (protein phosphatase 1-like) and VAPA or VAPB (VAMP-associated proteins A or B).

These functions require coordination between L1 and the actin cytoskeleton. F-actin continuously moves in a retrograde direction from the P-(peripheral) domain of the growth cone towards the growth cone's C-(central) domain. L1, attached to the actin cytoskeleton via membrane cytoskeletal linkers (MCKs) such as ankyrins (Ankyrin-G, -B and -R) and members of the ERMs (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family, link this retrograde F-actin flow with extracellular immobile ligands.Forward translocation of growth cone requires not only the CAM-actin linkage but also a gradient of cell substrate adhesion (strong adhesion at the front and weak adhesion at the rear) so that the cytoskeletal machinery is able to pull the cell forward as attachments at the rear are released. This asymmetry is achieved in part by internalizing L1 molecules as they are moved to the rear of the growth cone coupled to retrograde?F-actin flow and recycling them to the leading edge plasma membrane.L1 internalization is mediated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1CD) carries an endocytic or sorting motif, YRSLE, that is recognized by the clathrin associated adaptor protein-2 (AP-2). AP-2 binds the YRSLE motif only when its tyrosine is not phosphorylated and triggers L1 endocytosis. SRC kinase associated with lipid rafts in the P-domain membrane phosphorylates L1 molecules on tyrosine-1176, stabilizing them in the plasma membrane. L1 endocytosis is triggered by the dephosphorylation of Y1176 within the C domain. Some of these internalized L1 molecules are transported in an anterograde direction along microtubules for reuse in the leading edge.",NA,

The phosphorylation of CREB1 triggered by increased Ca2+ can be brought about by distinct molecular pathways that may involve MAP kinase, activation of adenylate cyclase and activation of CaMKIV (reviewed by Cohen and Greenberg 2008 and Hunt and Castillo 2012).

NMDA receptors are central to activity dependent changes in synaptic strength and are predominantly involved in the synaptic plasticity that pertains to learning and memory. A unique feature of NMDA receptors, unlike other glutamate receptors, is the requirement for dual activation, both voltage-dependent and ligand-dependent activation. The ligand-dependent activation of NMDA receptors requires co-activation by two ligands, glutamate and glycine. However, at resting membrane potential, the pore of ligand-bound NMDA receptors is blocked by Mg2+. The voltage dependent Mg2+ block is relieved upon depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane.

Smooth muscle tissue lacks the striated banding pattern characteristic of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle is triggered to contract by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, autocrine/paracrine agents, local chemical signals, and changes in load or length. Actin:myosin cross bridging is used to develop force with the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) initiating contraction. Two separate protein pathways, both triggered by calcium influx contribute to contraction, a calmodulin driven kinase pathway, and a caldesmon driven pathway. Recent evidence suggests that actin, myosin, and intermediate filaments may be far more volatile then previously suspected, and that changes in these cytoskeletal elements along with alterations of the focal adhesions that anchor these proteins may contribute to the contractile cycle. Contraction in smooth muscle generally uses a variant of the same sliding filament model found in striated muscle, except in smooth muscle the actin and myosin filaments are anchored to focal adhesions, and dense bodies, spread over the surface of the smooth muscle cell. When actin and myosin move across one another focal adhesions are drawn towards dense bodies, effectively squeezing the cell into a smaller conformation.

Each monomer contains a central channel formed in part by two asparagine-proline-alanine motifs (NPA boxes) that confer selectivity for water and/or solutes. The monomers assemble into tetramers. During passive transport by Aquaporins most aquaporins (i.e. AQP0/MIP, AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9, AQP10) transport water into and out of cells according to the osmotic gradient across the membrane. Four aquaporins (the aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, AQP9, AQP10) conduct glycerol, three aquaporins (AQP7, AQP9, AQP10) conduct urea, and one aquaporin (AQP6) conducts anions, especially nitrate. AQP8 also conducts ammonia in addition to water.AQP11 and AQP12, classified as group III aquaporins, were identified as a result of the genome sequencing project and are characterized by having variations in the first NPA box when compared to more traditional aquaporins. Additionally, a conserved cysteine?residue is present about 9 amino acids downstream from the second NPA box and this cysteine is considered indicative of group III aquaporins. Purified AQP11 incorporated into liposomes showed water transport. Knockout mice lacking AQP11 had fatal cyst formation in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Exogenously expressed AQP12 showed intracellular localization. AQP12 is expressed exclusively in pancreatic acinar cells.Aquaporins are important in fluid and solute transport in various tissues. During Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins, glycerol generated by triglyceride hydrolysis is exported from adipocytes by AQP7 and is imported into liver cells via AQP9. AQP1 plays a role in forming cerebrospinal fluid and AQP1, AQP4, and AQP9 appear to be important in maintaining fluid balance in the brain. AQP0, AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, AQP8, AQP9, and AQP11 play roles in the physiology of the hepatobiliary tract.In the kidney, water and solutes are passed out of the bloodstream and into the proximal tubule via the slit-like structure formed by nephrin in the glomerulus. Water is reabsorbed from the filtrate during its transit through the proximal tubule, the descending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in the proximal tubule and the descending thin limb of Henle is responsible for about 90% of reabsorption (as estimated from mouse knockouts of AQP1). AQP1 is located on both the apical and basolateral surface of epithelial cells and thus transports water through the epithelium and back into the bloodstream. In the collecting duct epithelial cells have AQP2 on their apical surfaces and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral surfaces to transport water across the epithelium. Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins by regulating the permeability of the epithelium through activation of a signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation of AQP2 and its translocation from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane of collecting duct cells.Here, three views of aquaporin-mediated transport have been annotated: a generic view of transport mediated by the various families of aquaporins independent of tissue type (Passive transport by Aquaporins), a view of the role of specific aquaporins in maintenance of renal water balance (Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins), and a view of the role of specific aquaporins in glycerol transport from adipocytes to the liver (Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins).",NA,

An early study in 1999 revealed that about 50% of the proteins in the Swiss-Prot database at the time were N-glycosylated (Apweiler et al. 1999). It is now established that the majority of the proteins in the secretory pathway require glycosylation in order to achieve proper folding.The addition of an N-glycan to a protein can have several roles (Shental-Bechor & Levy 2009). First, glycans enhance the solubility and stability of the proteins in the ER, the golgi and on the outside of the cell membrane, where the composition of the medium is strongly hydrophilic and where proteins, that are mostly hydrophobic, have difficulty folding properly. Second, N-glycans are used as signal molecules during the folding and transport process of the protein: they have the role of labels to determine when a protein must interact with?a chaperon, be transported to the golgi, or targeted for degradation in case of major folding defects. Third, and most importantly, N-glycans on completely folded proteins are involved in a wide range of processes: they help determine the specificity of membrane receptors in innate immunity or in cell-to-cell interactions, they can change the properties of hormones and secreted proteins, or of the proteins in the vesicular system inside the cell.All N-linked glycans are derived from a common 14-sugar oligosaccharide synthesized in the ER, which is attached co-translationally to a protein while this is being translated inside the reticulum. The process of the synthesis of this glycan, known as Synthesis of the N-glycan precursor or LLO, constitutes one of the most conserved pathways in eukaryotes, and has been also observed in some eubacteria. The attachment usually happens on an asparagine residue within the consensus sequence asparagine-X-threonine by an complex called oligosaccharyl transferase (OST).After being attached to an unfolded protein, the glycan is used as a label molecule in the folding process (also known as Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle) (Lederkremer 2009). The majority of the glycoproteins in the ER require at least one glycosylated residue in order to achieve proper folding, even if it has been shown that a smaller portion of the proteins in the ER can be folded without this modification.Once the glycoprotein has achieved proper folding, it is transported via the cis-Golgi through all the Golgi compartments, where the glycan is further modified according to the properties of the glycoprotein. This process involves relatively few enzymes but due to its combinatorial nature, can lead to several millions of different possible modifications. The exact topography of this network of reactions has not been established yet, representing one of the major challenges after the sequencing of the human genome (Hossler et al. 2006).Since N-glycosylation is involved in an great number of different processes, from cell-cell interaction to folding control, mutations in one of the genes involved in glycan assembly and/or modification can lead to severe development problems (often affecting the central nervous system). All the diseases in genes involved in glycosylation are collectively known as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) (Sparks et al. 2003), and classified as CDG type I for the genes in the LLO synthesis pathway, and CDG type II for the others",NA,

Active RSKs translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates such factors as c-Fos(on Ser362), SRF (Serum Response Factor) at Ser103, and CREB (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding protein) at Ser133.

The MAP kinases cascade transduces signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to a wide range of stimuli (Chang and Karin, 2001; Johnson et al, 2002). There are three major groups of MAP kinasesthe extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ERK1/2, the p38 MAP kinase and the c-Jun NH-terminal kinases JNK.ERK1 and ERK2 are activated in response to growth stimuli. Both JNKs and p38-MAPK are activated in response to a variety of cellular and environmental stresses. The MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within the tripeptide motif Thr-Xaa-Tyr. The sequence of this tripeptide motif is different in each group of MAP kinases: ERK (Thr-Glu-Tyr); p38 (Thr-Gly-Tyr); and JNK (Thr-Pro-Tyr).MAPK activation is mediated by signal transduction in the conserved three-tiered kinase?cascade: MAPKKKK (MAP4K or MKKKK or MAPKKK Kinase) activates the MAPKKK.

The ERK MAP kinases are activated by the MKK1 and MKK2; the p38 MAP kinases are activated by MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6; and the JNK pathway is activated by MKK4 and MKK7. The ability of MAP kinase kinases (MKKs, or MEKs) to recognize their cognate MAPKs is facilitated by a short docking motif (the D-site) in the MKK N-terminus, which binds to a complementary region on the MAPK.

In quiescent cells, the evolutionarily conserved DREAM complex, consisting of the pocket protein family member p130 (RBL2), bound to E2F4 or E2F5, and the MuvB complex, represses transcription of cell cycle genes (reviewed by Sadasivam and DeCaprio 2013).During early G1 phase in actively cycling cells, transcription of cell cycle genes is repressed by another pocket protein family member, p107 (RBL1), which forms a complex with E2F4 (Ferreira et al. 1998, Cobrinik 2005). RB1 tumor suppressor, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, is the third member of the pocket protein family. RB1 binds to E2F transcription factors E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 and inhibits their transcriptional activity, resulting in prevention of G1/S transition (Chellappan?et al. 1991, Bagchi et al. 1991, Chittenden et al. 1991, Lees et al. 1993, Hiebert 1993, Wu et al. 2001). Once RB1 is phosphorylated on serine residue S795 by Cyclin D:CDK4/6 complexes, it can no longer associate with and inhibit E2F1-3. Thus, CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of RB1 leads to transcriptional activation of E2F1-3 target genes needed for the S phase of the cell cycle (Connell-Crowley et al. 1997). CDK2, in complex with cyclin E, contributes to RB1 inactivation and also activates proteins needed for the initiation of DNA replication (Zhang 2007). Expression of D type cyclins is regulated by extracellular mitogens (Cheng et al. 1998, Depoortere et al. 1998). Catalytic activities of CDK4/6 and CDK2 are controlled by CDK inhibitors of the INK4 family (Serrano et al. 1993, Hannon and Beach 1994, Guan et al. 1994, Guan et al. 1996, Parry et al. 1995) and the Cip/Kip family, respectively.",NA,

Thrombin activates PARs by cleaving an N-terminal peptide that then binds to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling. Intermolecular ligation of one PAR molecule by another can occur but is less efficient than self-ligation. A synthetic peptide of sequence SFLLRN, the first six amino acids of the new N-terminus generated when thrombin cleaves PAR1, can activate PAR1 independent of protease and receptor cleavage. PARs are key to platelet activation. Four PARs have been identified, of which PARs 1 ,3 and 4 are substrates for thrombin. In humans PAR 1 is the predominant thrombin receptor followed by PAR4 which is less responsive to thrombin. PAR 3 is not considered important for human platelet responses as it is minimally expressed, though this is not the case for mouse. PAR2?is not expressed in platelets. In mouse platelets, Gq is necessary for platelet secretion and aggregation in response to thrombin but is not necessary for thrombin-triggered shape change. G13 appears to contribute to platelet aggregation as well as shape change in response to low concentrations of thrombin but to be unnecessary at higher agonist concentrations; G12 appears to be dispensable for thrombin signaling in platelets. G alpha (q) activates phospholipase C beta thereby triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases, GEFs, MAP kinase cassettes and other proteins that mediate cellular responses ranging from granule secretion, integrin activation, and aggregation in platelets. Gbeta:gamma subunits can activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase and other lipid modifying enzymes, protein kinases, and channels. PAR1 activation indirectly leads to activation of cell surface 'sheddases' that liberate ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, providing a link between thrombin and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell growth and differentiation. The pleiotrophic effects of PAR activation are consistent with many of thrombin's diverse actions on cells.",NA,

Most appear to have restricted specificities for nucleoside monophosphates, and to use ATP preferentially (Van Rompay et al. 2000; Anderson 1973; Noda 1973). The total number of human enzymes that catalyze these reactions in vivo is not clear. In six cases, a well-defined biochemical activity has been associated with a purified protein, and these are annotated here. However, additional nucleoside monophosphate kinase-like human proteins have been identified in molecular cloning studies whose enzymatic activities are unknown, and several distinctive nucleoside monophosphate kinase activities detected in cell extracts, e.g., a GTP-requiring adenylate kinase activity (Wilson?et al. 1976) and one or more guanylate kinase activities (Jamil et al. 1975) have not been unambiguously associated with specific human proteins.The nucleoside monophosphates against which each of the six well-characterized enzymes is active is shown in the table (Van Rompay et al. 2000). All six efficiently use ATP as a phosphate donor, but have some activity with other nucleoside triphosphates as well in vitro. The high concentrations of ATP relative to other nucleoside triphosphates in vivo makes it the likely major phosphate donor in these reactions under most conditions.All of these phosphorylation reactions are freely reversible in vitro when carried out with purified enzymes and substrates, having equilibrium constants near 1. In vivo, high ratios of ATP to ADP are likely to favor the forward direction of these reactions, i.e., the conversion of (d)NMP and ATP to (d)NDP and ADP. At the same time, the reversibility of the reactions and the overlapping substrate specificities of the enzymes raises the possibility that this group of reactions can buffer the intracellular nucleotide pool and regulate the relative concentrations of individual nucleotides in the pool: if any one molecule builds up to unusually high levels, multiple routes appear to be open not only to dispose of it but to use it to increase the supply of less abundant nucleotides.Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates from ribonucleotide diphosphates",NA,

GPCRs are also the largest class of drug targets, involved in virtually all physiological processes (Frederiksson 2003). GPCRs are receptors for a diverse range of ligands from large proteins to photons (Kristiansen et al. 2004) and have an equal diversity of ligand-binding mechanisms (Gether et al. 2002). Classical GPCR signaling involves signal transduction via heterotrimeric G-proteins, though G-protein independent mechanisms have been reported. Rhodopsin-like receptors (class A/1) are by far the largest group of GPCRs and the best studied, though a large proportion of the functional and structural studies have focused on a very few members; many remain functionally uncharacterized. This large family can be subdivided into at least 19 subfamilies (Subfamily A1-19) based on phylogenetic analysis (Joost & Methner 2002). Family A includes receptors for a wide variety of ligands including hormones, light and neurotransmitters, encompassing a wide range of functions including many autocrine, paracrine and endocrine processes. The secretin-like family B/2 GPCRs includes receptors for many hormone-like peptides, such as secretin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptides and vasoactive intestinal peptide, which activate adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium pathway (Harmar 2001).

Both subunits contain extracellular conserved motifs typical of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The cytoplasmic domains have limited similarity with other cytokine receptors and lack detectable catalytic domains such as tyrosine kinase domains. IL-3 is a 20-26 kDa product of CD4+ T cells that acts on the most immature marrow progenitors. IL-3 is capable of inducing the growth and differentiation of multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, macrophages, lymphoid and erythroid cells. IL-3 has been used to support the proliferation of murine cell lines with properties of multi-potential progenitors, immature myeloid as well as T and pre-B lymphoid cells (Miyajima et al. 1992). IL-5 is a hematopoietic?growth factor responsible for the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils. It was originally defined as a T-cell-derived cytokine that triggers activated B cells for terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. It also promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. IL-5 induces the expression of IL-2 receptors (Kouro & Takatsu 2009). GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) found at sites of inflammatory responses. It stimulates the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages, and the production and maturation of dendritic cells. It stimulates myeloblast and monoblast differentiation, synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells, acts as an autocrine mediator of growth for some types of acute myeloid leukemia, is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils. It enhances the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Under steady-state conditions GM-CSF is not essential for the production of myeloid cells, but it is required for the proper development of alveolar macrophages, otherwise, pulmonary alvelolar proteinosis (PAP) develops. A growing body of evidence suggests that GM-CSF plays a key role in emergency hematopoiesis (predominantly myelopoiesis) in response to infection, including the production of granulocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow and their maintenance, survival, and functional activation at sites of injury or insult (Hercus et al. 2009). All three receptors have alpha chains that bind their specific ligands with low affinity (de Groot et al. 1998). Bc then associates with the alpha chain forming a high affinity receptor (Geijsen et al. 2001), though the in vivo receptor is likely be a higher order multimer as recently demonstrated for the GM-CSF receptor (Hansen et al. 2008). The receptor chains lack intrinsic kinase activity, instead they interact with and activate signaling kinases, notably Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). These phosphorylate the common beta subunit, allowing recruitment of signaling molecules such as Shc, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). The cytoplasmic domain of Bc has two distinct functional domains: the membrane proximal region mediates the induction of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc, pim-1 and oncostatin M. This region binds multiple signal-transducing proteins including JAK2 (Quelle et al. 1994), STATs, c-Src and PI3 kinase (Rao and Mufson, 1995). The membrane distal domain is required for cytokine-induced growth inhibition and is necessary for the viability of hematopoietic cells (Inhorn et al. 1995). This region interacts with signal-transducing proteins such as Shc (Inhorn et al. 1995) and SHP and mediates the transcriptional activation of c-fos, c-jun, c-Raf and p70S6K (Reddy et al. 2000).Figure reproduced by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Leukemia, WL Blalock et al. 13:1109-1166, copyright 1999.

Both lef and cya depend on pagA to enter their target cells, a strategy characteristic of bacterial binary toxins (Barth et al. 2004). pagA binds to the target cell receptors, is cleaved by furin or other cellular proteases, and thereupon forms an oligomer that exposes binding sites for lef and cya molecules (Young and Collier 2007).

The initiation of necroptosis can be stimulated by the same death ligands that activate extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, Fas ligand (FasL), and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) or toll like receptors 3 and 4 ligands (Holler N et al. 2000; He S et al. 2009; Feoktistova M et al. 2011; Voigt S et al. 2014). In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis represents a form of cell death that is optimally induced when caspases are inhibited (Holler N et al. 2000; Hopkins-Donaldson S et al. 2000; Sawai H 2014). Specific inhibitors of caspase-independent necrosis,?necrostatins, have recently been identified (Degterev A et al. 2005, 2008). Necrostatins have been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of RIPK1 (Degterev A et al. 2008). Importantly, cell death of apoptotic morphology can be shifted to a necrotic phenotype when caspase 8 activity is compromised, otherwise active caspase 8 blocks necroptosis by the proteolytic cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Kalai M et al. 2002; Degterev A et al. 2008; Lin Y et al. 1999; Feng S et al. 2007). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is engaged in physical and functional interactions with the cognate kinase RIPK3 leading to formation of necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al. 2009). Within the necrosome RIPK1 and RIPK3 bind to each other through their RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains. The RHIMs can facilitate RIPK1:RIPK3 oligomerization, allowing them to form amyloid-like fibrillar structures (Li J et al. 2012; Mompean M et al. 2018). RIPK3 in turn interacts with mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) (Sun L et al. 2012; Zhao J et al. 2012; Murphy JM et al. 2013; Chen W et al. 2013). The precise mechanism of MLKL activation by RIPK3 is incompletely understood and may vary across species (Davies KA et al. 2020). Mouse MLKL activation relies on transient engagement of RIPK3 to facilitate phosphorylation of the pseudokinase domain (Murphy JM et al. 2013; Petrie EJ et al. 2019a), while it appears that stable recruitment of human MLKL by necrosomal RIPK3 is an additional crucial step in human MLKL activation (Davies KA et al. 2018; Petrie EJ et al. 2018, 2019b). RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation is thought to initiate MLKL oligomerization, membrane translocation and membrane disruption (Sun L et al. 2012; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2020; Samson AL et al. 2020). Studies in human cell lines suggest that upon induction of necroptosis MLKL shifts to the plasma membrane and membranous organelles such as mitochondria, lysosome, endosome and ER (Wang H et al. 2014), but it is trafficking via a Golgi-microtubule-actin-dependent mechanism that facilitates plasma membrane translocation, where membrane disruption causes death (Samson AL et al. 2020). The mechanisms of necroptosis regulation and execution downstream of MLKL remain elusive. The precise oligomeric form of MLKL that mediates plasma membrane disruption has been highly debated (Cai Z et al. 2014; Chen X et al. 2014; Dondelinger Y et al. 2014; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2017, 2018; Samson AL et al. 2020 ). However, microscopy data revealed that MLKL assembles into higher molecular weight species upon cytoplasmic necrosomes within human cells, and upon phosphorylation by RIPK3, MLKL is trafficked to the plasma membrane (Samson AL et al. 2020). At the plasma membrane, phospho-MLKL forms heterogeneous higher order assemblies, which are thought to permeabilize cells, leading to release of DAMPs to invoke inflammatory responses. While RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL are the core signaling components in the necroptosis pathway, many additional molecules have been proposed to positively and negatively tune the signaling pathway. Currently, this picture is evolving rapidly as new modulators continue to be discovered.The Reactome module describes MLKL-mediated necroptotic events on the plasma membrane.",NA,

However, accumulating evidence suggests that necrosis, like apoptosis, can be executed by genetically controlled and highly regulated cellular process that is morphologically characterized by a loss of cell membrane integrity, intracellular organelles and/or the entire cell swelling (oncosis) (Rello S et al. 2005; Galluzzi L et al. 2007; Berghe TV et al. 2014; Ros U et al. 2020). The morphological hallmarks of the nectotic death have been associated with different forms of programmed cell death including (but not limited to) parthanatos, necroptosis, glutamate-induced oxytosis, ferroptosis, inflammasome-mediated necrosis etc. Each of them can be triggered under certain pathophysiological conditions. For example UV, ROS or alkylating agents may induce poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation (parthanatos), while tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or toll like receptor ligands (LPS and dsRNA) can trigger?necrosome-mediated necroptosis. The initiation events, e.g., PARP1 hyperactivation, necrosome formation, activation of NADPH oxidases, in turn trigger one or several common intracellular signals such as NAD+ and ATP-depletion, enhanced Ca2+ influx, dysregulation of the redox status, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of phospholipases. These signals affect cellular organelles and membranes leading to osmotic swelling, massive energy depletion, lipid peroxidation and the loss of lysosomal membrane integrity. Different mechanisms of permeabilization have emerged depending on the cell death form. Pore formation by gasdermins (GSDMs) is a hallmark of pyroptosis, while mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein facilitates membrane permeabilization in necroptosis, and phospholipid peroxidation leads to membrane damage in ferroptosis. This diverse repertoire of mechanisms leading to membrane permeabilization contributes to define the specific inflammatory and immunological outcome of each type of regulated necrosis. Regulated or programmed necrosis eventually leads to cell lysis and release of cytoplasmic content into the extracellular region that is often associated with a tissue damage resulting in an intense inflammatory response.The Reactome module describes necroptosis and pyroptosis.",NA,

NO has been reported to be a downstream mediator in the angiogenic response mediated by VEGF, but the mechanism by which NO promotes neovessel formation is not clear (Babaei & Stewart 2002). Persistent vasodilation and increase in vascular permeability in the existing vasculature is observed during the early steps of angiogenesis, suggesting that these hemodynamic changes are indispensable during an angiogenic processes. NO production by VEGF can occur either through the activation of PI3K or through a PLC-gamma dependent manner. Once activated both pathways converge on AKT phosphorylation of eNOS, releasing NO (Lin & Sessa 2006).

Cytosine demethylation is developmentally regulated: one wave of demethylation occurs in primordial germ cells and one wave occurs by active demethylation in the male pronucleus after fertilization.Some mechanisms of active demethylation remain controversial, however progressive oxidation of the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine followed by base excision by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) has been reproducibly demonstrated in vivo (reviewed in Wu and Zhang 2011, Franchini et al 2012, Cadet and Wagner 2013, Kohli and Zhang 2013, Ponnaluri et al. 2013, Rasmussen and Helin 2016). Ten-eleven translocation proteins TET1, TET2,?and TET3 are dioxygenases that first oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009, Ito et al. 2010), which is found in significant quantities and specific genomic locations in stem cells and neurons (Kinney and Pradhan 2013). TET proteins can further oxidize 5-hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and then 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) (He et al. 2011, Ito et al. 2011). G:5-fC and G:5-caC base pairs are recognized by TDG, which excises the 5-fC or 5-caC and leaves an abasic site.TET1 in mouse is expressed in neurons and its expression depends on neuronal activity (Guo et al. 2011, Kaas et al. 2013, Zhang et al. 2013).

Here, one regulatory feature of this process has been annotated, the signaling cascade initiated by CDO (cell-adhesion-molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes) and associated co-receptors.CDO/Cdon is a type I transmembrane multifunctional co-receptor consisting of five immunoglobulin and three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats in the extracellular domain, and an intracellular domain with no identifiable motifs. It has been implicated in enhancing muscle differentiation in promyogenic cells. CDO exert its promyogenic effects as a component of multiprotein complexes that include the closely related factor Boc, the Ig superfamily receptor neogenin and its ligand netrin-3, and the adhesion molecules N- and M-cadherin. CDO modulates the Cdc42 and p38 mitogen-activatedÂ protein kinase (MAPK) pathways via a direct association with two scaffold-type proteins, JLP and Bnip-2, to regulate activities of myogenic bHLH factors and myogenic differentiation. CDO activates myogenic bHLH factors via enhanced heterodimer formation, most likely by inducing hyper-phosphorylation of E proteins. Myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are master regulatory proteins that activate the transcription of many muscle-specific genes during myogenesis. These myogenic bHLH proteins also referred to as MyoD family includes four members, MyoD, myogenin, myf5 and MRF4. These myogenic factors dimerize with E-proteins such as E12/E47, ITF-2 and HEB to form heterodimeric complexes that bind to a conserved DNA sequence known as the E box, which is present in the promoters and enhancers of most muscle-specific genes. Myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2), which is a member of the MADS box family, also plays an important role in muscle differentiation. MEF2 activates transcription by binding to the consensus sequence, called the MEF2-binding site, which is also found in the control regions of numerous muscle-specific genes. MEF2 and myogenic bHLH proteins synergistically activate expression of muscle-specific genes via protein-protein interactions between DNA-binding domains of these heterologous classes of transcription factors.

After this point the N-glycan is progressively trimmed of the three glucoses and some of the mannoses before the protein is transported to the cis-Golgi. The role of these trimming reactions is that the N-glycan attached to an unfolded glycoprotein in the ER assume the role of 'tags' that direct the interactions of the glycoprotein with different elements that mediate its folding. The removal of the two outer glucoses leads to an N-glycan with only one glucose, which is a signal for the binding of either one of two chaperone proteins, calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These chaperones provide an environment where the protein can fold more easily. The interaction with these proteins is not transient and is terminated by the trimming of the last remaining glucose, after which the glycoprotein is released from?CNX or CRT and directed to the ER Quality Control compartment (ERQC) if it still has folding defects, or transported to the Golgi if the folding is correct. The involvement of N-glycans in the folding quality control of proteins in the ER explains why this form of glycosylation is so important, and why defects in the enzymes involved in these reactions are frequently associated with congenital diseases.

Promoter regions tend to have a high CG-content, forming so-called CG-islands (CGIs), while the CG-content in the remaining part of the genome is much lower. CGIs tend to be unmethylated, while the majority of CGs outside CGIs are methylated. Methylation in promoters and first exons tends to repress transcription while methylation in gene bodies (regions of genes downstream of the promoter and first exon) correlates with transcription (reviewed in Ehrlich and Lacey 2013, Kulis et al. 2013).

These secreted morphogens can remain associated with lipid rafts on the surface of the secreting cell and affect developmental processes in adjacent cells. Alternatively, they can be released by proteolysis or packaging into vesicles or lipoprotein particles and dispersed to act on distant cells. SHH activity is required for organization of the limb bud, notochord and neural plate, IHH regulates bone and cartilage development and is partially redundant with SHH, and DHH contributes to germ cell development in the testis and formation of the peripheral nerve sheath (reviewed in Pan et al, 2013). Despite divergent biological roles, all Hh ligands are subject to proteolytic processing and lipid modification during transit to the surface of the secreting cell (reviewed in Gallet, 2011). Precursor Hh undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage mediated by the C-terminal region to?yield an amino-terminal peptide Hh-Np (also referred to as Hh-N) (Chen et al, 2011). No other well defined role for the C-terminal region of Hh has been identified, and the secreted Hh-Np is responsible for all Hh signaling activity. Hh-Np is modified with cholesterol and palmitic acid during transit through the secretory system, and both modifications contribute to the activity of the ligand (Porter et al, 1996; Pepinsky et al, 1998; Chamoun et al, 2001). At the cell surface, Hh-Np remains associated with the secreting cell membrane by virtue of its lipid modifications, which promote clustering of Hh-Np into lipid rafts (Callejo et al, 2006; Peters et al, 2004). Long range dispersal of Hh-Np depends on the untethering of the ligand from the membrane through a variety of mechanisms. These include release of monomers through the combined activity of the transmembrane protein Dispatched (DISP2) and the secreted protein SCUBE2, assembly into soluble multimers or apolipoprotein particles or release on the surface of exovesicles (Vyas et al, 2008; Tukachinsky et al, 2012; Chen 2004; Zeng et al, 2001; reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).",NA,

Hh signaling also contributes to stem cell homeostasis in adult tissues. Downregulation of Hh signaling can lead to neonatal abnormalities, while upregulation of signaling is associated with the development of various cancers (Beachy et al, 2004; Jiang and Hui, 2008; Hui and Angers, 2011).Hh signaling is switched between 'off' and an 'on' states to differentially regulate an intracellular signaling cascade that targets the Gli transcription factors. In the absence of Hh ligand, cytosolic Gli proteins are cleaved to yield a truncated form that translocates into the nucleus and represses target gene transcription. Binding of Hh to the Patched (PTC) receptor on the cell surface stabilizes the Gli proteins in their full-length transcriptional activator form, stimulating Hh-dependent?gene expression (reviewed in Hui and Angers, 2011; Briscoe and Therond, 2013).",NA,

No other protein is known to undergo this modification. The diphthamide residue is also the target of ADP ribosylation catalyzed by diphtheria toxin, which inactivates EEF2 and leads to cell death (Collier 1975; Pappenheim 1977).Diphthamide synthesis proceeds in four steps: the transfer of 3 amino 3 carboxypropyl group from S adenosylmethionine to histidine 715 of EEF2, the addition of four methyl groups to the 3 amino 3 carboxypropyl moiety, the demethylation of the methylated carboxylate group to form diphthine, and the amidation of the diphthine carboxyl group (Liu et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2014; Schaffrath et al. 2014; Su et al. 2013; Uthman et al. 2013).",NA,

MMR is primarily associated with DNA replication and is highly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. MMR consists of the following basic steps: a sensor (MutS homologue) detects a mismatch or IDL, the sensor activates a set of proteins (a MutL homologue and an exonuclease) that select the nascent DNA strand to be repaired, nick the strand, exonucleolytically remove a region of nucleotides containing the mismatch, and finally a DNA polymerase resynthesizes the strand and a ligase seals the remaining nick (reviewed in Kolodner and Marsischkny 1999, Iyer et al. 2006, Li 2008, Fukui 2010, Jiricny 2013). Humans have 2 different MutS complexes. The MSH2:MSH6 heterodimer (MutSalpha) recognizes single base mismatches and small loops of one or two unpaired bases. The MSH2:MSH3 heterodimer (MutSbeta) recognizes loops of two or more unpaired bases. Upon binding?a mismatch, the MutS complex becomes activated in an ATP-dependent manner allowing for subsequent downstream interactions and movement on the DNA substrate. (There are two mechanisms proposed: a sliding clamp and a switch diffusion model.) Though the order of steps and structural details are not fully known, the activated MutS complex interacts with MLH1:PMS2 (MutLalpha) and PCNA, the sliding clamp present at replication foci. The role of PCNA is multifaceted as it may act as a processivity factor in recruiting MMR proteins to replicating DNA, interact with MLH1:PMS2 and Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) to initiate excision of the recently replicated strand and direct DNA polymerase delta to initiate replacement of bases. MLH1:PMS2 makes an incision in the strand to be repaired and EXO1 extends the incision to make a single-stranded gap of up to 1 kb that removes the mismatched base(s). (Based on assays of purified human proteins, there is also a variant of the mismatch repair pathway that does not require EXO1, however the mechanism is not clear. EXO1 is almost always required, it is possible that the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase delta may compensate in some situations and it has been proposed that other endonucleases may perform redundant functions in the absence of EXO1.) RPA binds the single-stranded region and a new strand is synthesized across the gap by DNA polymerase delta. The remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase I (LIG1).Concentrations of MMR proteins MSH2:MSH6 and MLH1:PMS2 increase in human cells during S phase and are at their highest level and activity during this phase of the cell cycle (Edelbrock et al. 2009). Defects in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome) (reviewed in Martin-Lopez and Fishel 2013).",NA,

The retinoid used as a cofactor in the visual cycle is 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL). The non-visual cycle effects of retinol are mediated by retinoic acid (RA), generated by two-step conversion from retinol (Napoli 2012). All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the major activated metabolite of retinol. An isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) has biological activity, but has not been detected in vivo, except in the pancreas. An alternative route involves BCO1 cleavage of carotenoids into retinal, which is then reduced into retinol in the intestine (Harrison 2012).

The remainder, including all proteins of the mitochondrial translation system, are encoded in the nucleus and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Translation in the mitochondrion reflects both the bacterial origin of the organelle and subsequent divergent evolution during symbiosis (reviewed in Huot et al. 2014, Richman et al. 2014). Human mitochondrial ribosomes have a low sedimentation coefficient of only 55S, but at 2.71 MDa they retain a similar mass to E. coli 70S particles. The 55S particles are protein-rich compared to both cytosolic ribosomes and eubacterial ribosomes. This is due to shorter?mt-rRNAs, mitochondria-specific proteins, and numerous rearrangements in individual protein positions within the two ribosome subunits (inferred from bovine ribosomes in Sharma et al. 2003, Greber et al. 2014, Kaushal et al. 2014, reviewed in Agrawal and Sharma 2012).Mitochondrial mRNAs have either no untranslated leader or short leaders of 1-3 nucleotides, with the exception of the 2 bicistronic transcripts, RNA7 and RNA14, which have overlapping orfs that encode ND4L/ND4 and ATP8/ATP6 respectively. Translation is believed to initiate with the mRNA binding the 28S subunit:MTIF3 (28S subunit:IF-3Mt, 28S subunit:IF2mt) complex together with MTIF2:GTP (IF-2Mt:GTP, IF2mt:GTP) at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Christian and Spremulli 2012). MTIF3 can dissociate 55S particles in preparation for initiation, enhances formation of initiation complexes, and inhibits N-formylmethionine-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) binding to 28S subunits in the absence of mRNA. Binding of fMet-tRNA to the start codon of the mRNA results in a stable complex while absence of a start codon at the 5' end of the mRNA causes eventual dissociation of the mRNA from the 28S subunit. After recognition of a start codon, the 39S subunit then binds the stable complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the initiation factors MTIF3 and MTIF2:GDP dissociate.Translation elongation then proceeds by cycles of aminoacyl-tRNAs binding, peptide bond formation, and displacement of deacylated tRNAs. In each cycle an aminoacyl-tRNA in a complex with TUFM:GTP (EF-Tu:GTP) binds at the A-site of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed, and TUFM:GDP dissociates. The elongating polypeptide bonded to the tRNA at the P-site is transferred to the aminoacyl group at the A-site by peptide bond formation at the peptidyl transferase center, leaving a deacylated tRNA at the P-site and the elongating polypeptide attached to the tRNA at the A-site. The polypeptide is co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane via an interaction with OXA1L (Haque et al. 2010, reviewed in Ott and Hermann 2010). After peptide bond formation, GFM1:GTP (EF-Gmt:GTP) then binds the ribosome complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, GFM1:GDP dissociates, and the ribosome translocates 3 nucleotides in the 3' direction along the mRNA, relocating the polypeptide-tRNA to the P-site and allowing another cycle to begin. TUFM:GDP is regenerated to TUFM:GTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TSFM (EF-Ts, EF-TsMt).Translation is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP (MTRF1a:GTP) recognizes an UAA or UAG termination codon at the A-site of the ribosome (Tsuboi et al. 2009). GTP hydrolysis does not appear to be required. The tRNA-aminoacyl bond between the translated polypeptide and the final tRNA at the P-site is hydrolyzed by the 39S subunit, facilitating release of the polypeptide.

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most potent naturally occurring carcinogen known and is also an immunosuppressant. It is a potent hepatocarcinogenic agent in many species, and has been implicated in the etiology of human hepatocellular carcinoma. Poultry, especially turkeys, are extremely sensitive to the toxic and carcinogenic action of AFB1 present in animal feed, resulting in multi-million dollar losses to the industry. Discerning the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of this extreme sensitivity of poultry to AFB1 will help with the development of new strategies to increase aflatoxin resistance (Rawal et al. 2010, Diaz & Murcia 2011).AFB1 has one major genotoxic metabolic fate, conversion to AFXBO, and several others that are less mutagenic but that can still be quite?toxic. AFB1 can be oxidised to the toxic AFB1 exo 8,9 epoxide (AFXBO) product by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially P450 3A4 in the liver. This 8,9 epoxide can react with the N7 atom of a guanyl base of DNA to produce adducts by intercalating between DNA base pairs. The exo epoxide is unstable in solution, however, and can react spontaneously to form a diol that is no longer reactive with DNA. The diol product in turn undergoes base-catalysed rearrangement to a dialdehyde that can react with protein lysine residues. AFB1 can also be metabolised to products (AFQ1, AFM1, AFM1E) which have far less genotoxic consequences than AFB1. The main route of detoxification of AFB1 is conjugation of its reactive 8,9-epoxide form with glutathione (GSH). This reaction is carried out by trimeric glutathione transferases (GSTs), providing a chemoprotective mechanism against toxicity. Glutathione conjugates are usually excreted as mercapturic acids in urine (Guengerich et al. 1998, Hamid et al. 2013). The main metabolic routes of aflatoxin in humans are described here",NA,

They include ketone bodies, fatty acids, triacylglycerols, phospholipids and sphingolipids, eicosanoids, cholesterol, bile salts, steroid hormones, and fat-soluble vitamins. They function as a major source of energy (fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and ketone bodies), are major constituents of cell membranes (cholesterol and phospholipids), play a major role in their own digestion and uptake (bile salts), and participate in numerous signaling and regulatory processes (steroid hormones, eicosanoids, phosphatidylinositols, and sphingolipids) (Vance & Vance 2008 - URL).The central steroid in human biology is cholesterol, obtained from animal fats consumed in the diet or synthesized de novo from acetyl-coenzyme A. (Vegetable fats contain various sterols but no cholesterol.) Cholesterol is an essential constituent of lipid bilayer membranes and is the starting point for the biosyntheses?of bile acids and salts, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. Bile acids and salts are mostly synthesized in the liver. They are released into the intestine and function as detergents to solubilize dietary fats. Steroid hormones are mostly synthesized in the adrenal gland and gonads. They regulate energy metabolism and stress responses (glucocorticoids), salt balance (mineralocorticoids), and sexual development and function (androgens and estrogens). At the same time, chronically elevated cholesterol levels in the body are associated with the formation of atherosclerotic lesions and hence increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. The human body lacks a mechanism for degrading excess cholesterol, although an appreciable amount is lost daily in the form of bile salts and acids that escape recycling.Aspects of lipid metabolism currently annotated in Reactome include lipid digestion, mobilization, and transport; fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism; peroxisomal lipid metabolism; phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism; cholesterol biosynthesis; bile acid and bile salt metabolism; and steroid hormone biosynthesis",NA,

The mechanism must elicit rapid changes in heart rate and respond to changes in autonomic tone. The cardiac action potential controls these functions. Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions through transmembrane ion channels in cardiac cells. Like skeletal myocytes (and axons), in the resting state, a given cardiac myocyte has a negative membrane potential. In both muscle types, after a delay (the absolute refractory period), K+ channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarisation. The voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the cardiac sarcolemma membrane are generally triggered by an influx of Na+ during phase 0 of the action potential. Cardiac muscle cells are so tightly bound that when one of these cells is excited the action potential spreads to all of them. The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is?the action potential of the ventricular myocyte (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).The action potential has 5 phases (numbered 0-4). Phase 4 describes the membrane potential when a cell is not being stimulated. The normal resting potential in the ventricular myocardium is between -85 to -95 mV. The K+ gradient across the cell membrane is the key determinant in the normal resting potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarisation phase in which electrical stimulation of a cell opens the closed, fast Na+ channels, causing a large influx of Na+ creating a Na+ current (INa+). This causes depolarisation of the cell. The slope of phase 0 represents the maximum rate of potential change and differs in contractile and pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is the inactivation of the fast Na+ channels. The transient net outward current causing the small downward deflection (the ""notch"" of the action potetial) is due to the movement of K+ and Cl- ions. In pacemaker cells, this phase is due to rapid K+ efflux and closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. Phase 2 is the plateau phase which is sustained by a balance of Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. This phase sustains muscle contraction. Phase 3 of the action potential is where a concerted action of two outward delayed currents brings about repolarisation back down to the resting potential (Bartos et al. 2015).",NA,

Components of the RNAi machinery (ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1, EIF2C1), AGO2 (EIF2C2), AGO3 (EIF2C3), AGO4 (EIF2C4), TNRC6A, and DICER) are observed associated with microRNAs (miRNAs) in both the cytosol and the nucleus (Robb et al. 2005, Weinmann et al. 2009, Doyle et al. 2013, Nishi et al. 2013, Gagnon et al. 2014). The AGO:miRNA complexes are imported into the nucleus by IMPORTIN-8 (IPO8, IMP8, RANBP8) and also by an unknown importin while associated with the nuclear shuttling protein TNRC6A (reviewed in Schraivogel and Meister 2014).Within the nucleus, AGO2, TNRC6A, and DICER may associate in a complex (Gagnon et al. 2014).

These longer transcripts are processed to yield piRNAs of 26-30 nucleotides independently of DICER, the enzyme responsible for microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (reviewed in Girard and Hannon 2008, Siomi et al. 2011, Ishizu et al. 2012, Pillai and Chuma 2012, Bortvin 2013, Chuma and Nakano 2013, Sato and Siomi 2013). The initial step in processing long transcripts to piRNAs is cleavage by PLD6 (MitoPLD), which generates the mature 5' end. The cleavage products of PLD6 are bound by either PIWIL1 (HIWI, MIWI) or PIWIL2 (HILI, MILI) in complexes with several other proteins. The 3' end is trimmed by an unknown exonuclease to generate the mature piRNA. PIWIL1:piRNA complexes appear to be involved in post-transcriptional silencing in the cytosol while PIWIL2:piRNA?complexes generate further piRNAs from transposon transcripts and other transcripts in the cytosol. Cleavage products from PIWIL2:piRNA may be loaded into either PIWIL2 or PIWIL4 (HIWI2, MIWI2). Loading into PIWIL2 forms a step in a cytosolic amplification loop called the ""ping-pong cycle"" which yields further PIWIL2:piRNA complexes from cleaved precursor RNAs. Loading into PIWIL4 yields a complex also containing TDRD9 that translocates to the nucleus and directs DNA methylation of cognate loci, causing transcriptional silencing during spermatogenesis.

CLEC7A belongs to thetype-II C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family that can mediate its own intracellular signaling. Upon binding particulate beta-1,3-glucans, CLEC7A mediates intracellular signalling through its cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like motif (Brown 2006). CLEC7A signaling can induce the production of various cytokines and chemokines, including tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), CXC-chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2, also known as MIP2), interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 (Brown et al. 2003), it also triggers phagocytosis and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus contributing to microbial killing (Gantner et al. 2003, Herre?et al. 2004, Underhill et al. 2005, Goodridge at al. 2011, Reid et al. 2009). These cellular responses mediated by CLEC7A rely on both Syk-dependent and Syk-independent signaling cascades. The pathways leading to the Syk-dependent activation of NF-kB can be categorised into both canonical and non-canonical routes (Gringhuis et al. 2009). Activation of the canonical NF-kB pathway is essential for innate immunity, whereas activation of the non-canonical pathway is involved in lymphoid organ development and adaptive immunity (Plato et al. 2013).",NA,

In Drosophila in the absence of Hh signaling, full-length Ci is partially degraded by the proteasome to generate a truncated repressor form that translocates to the nucleus to represses Hh-responsive genes. Binding of Hh ligand to the Patched (PTC) receptor allows the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) to be activated in an unknown manner, disrupting the partial proteolysis of Ci and allowing the full length activator form to accumulate (reviewed in Ingham et al, 2011; Briscoe and Therond, 2013). While many of the core components of Hh signaling are conserved from flies to humans, the pathways do show points of significant divergence. Notably, the human genome encodes three Ci homologues, GLI1, 2 and 3 that each play slightly different roles in regulating Hh responsive genes. GLI3 is the primary repressor of Hh signaling?in vertebrates, and is converted to the truncated GLI3R repressor form in the absence of Hh. GLI2 is a potent activator of transcription in the presence of Hh but contributes only minimally to the repression function. While a minor fraction of GLI2 protein is processed into the repressor form in the absence of Hh, the majority is either fully degraded by the proteasome or sequestered in the full-length form in the cytosol by protein-protein interactions. GLI1 lacks the repression domain and appears to be an obligate transcriptional activator (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013). Vertebrate but not fly Hh signaling also depends on the movement of pathway components through the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a non-motile microtubule based structure whose construction and maintenance depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde IFT moves molecules from the ciliary base along the axoneme to the ciliary tip in a manner that requires the microtubule-plus-end directed kinesin KIF3 motor complex and the IFT-B protein complex, while retrograde IFT back to the ciliary base depends on the minus-end directed dynein motor and the IFT-A complex. Genetic screens have identified a number of cilia-related proteins that are required both to maintain Hh in the 'off' state and to transduce the signal when the pathway is activated (reviewed in Hui and Angers, 2011; Goetz and Anderson, 2010).",NA,

Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). This specialized compartment is established and maintained during cilium biogenesis by the formation of a ciliary transition zone, a proteinaceous structure that, with the transition fibres, anchors the basal body to the plasma membrane and acts as a ciliary pore to limit free diffusion from the cytosol to the cilium (reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Reiter et al, 2012). Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and?The primary cilium is a sensory organelle that is required for the transduction of numerous external signals such as growth factors, hormones and morphogens, and an intact primary cilium is needed for signaling pathways mediated by Hh, WNT, calcium, G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, among others (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Berbari et al, 2009; Nachury, 2014). Unlike the motile cilia, which are generally present in large numbers on epithelial cells and are responsible for sensory function as well as wave-like beating motions, the primary cilium is a non-motile sensory organelle that is present in a single copy at the apical surface of most quiescent cells (reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012). Cilium biogenesis involves the anchoring of the basal body, a centriole-derived organelle, near the plasma membrane and the subsequent polymerization of the microtubule-based axoneme and extension of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). This specialized compartment is established and maintained during cilium biogenesis by the formation of a ciliary transition zone, a proteinaceous structure that, with the transition fibres, anchors the basal body to the plasma membrane and acts as a ciliary pore to limit free diffusion from the cytosol to the cilium (reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Reiter et al, 2012). Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and subsequently transported to the ciliary tip, where extension of the axoneme occurs, by a motor-driven process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde transport of cargo from the ciliary base to the tip of the cilium requires kinesin-2 type motors, while the dynein-2 motor is required for retrograde transport back to the ciliary base. In addition, both anterograde and retrograde transport depend on the IFT complex, a multiprotein assembly consisting of two subcomplexes, IFT A and IFT B. The primary cilium is a dynamic structure that undergoes continuous steady-state turnover of tubulin at the tip; as a consequence, the IFT machinery is required for cilium maintenance as well as biogenesis (reviewed in Bhogaraju et al, 2013; Hsiao et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012; Taschner et al, 2012; Sung and Leroux, 2013). The importance of the cilium in signaling and cell biology is highlighted by the wide range of defects and disorders, collectively known as ciliopathies, that arise as the result of mutations in genes encoding components of the ciliary machinery (reviewed in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Madhivanan and Aguilar, 2014).",NA,

The centriole consists of a multiprotein core surrounded by a ring of nine microtubule triplets; the mother centriole additionally has 'distal' and 'subdistal appendages' that are critical for ciliogenesis (reviewed in Kim and Dynlacht, 2013; Firat-Karalar and Stearns, 2014; Bettencourt-Dias et al, 2011). Basal bodies initiate and anchor the extension of the axonemal microtubules and also associate with secretory vesicles which are thought to provide membrane components for the extension of the ciliary membrane (Sorokin, 1962; Sorokin, 1968; Bachmann-Gagescu et al, 2011; Tanos et al, 2013; reviewed in Ishikawa et al, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Basal bodies are attached to the plasma membrane through a proteinaceous network of transition fibers that form part of the 'transition zone' at the ciliary base. The transition zone acts as a selective barrier or ciliary pore, excluding vesicles and limiting the diffusion of proteins and lipids from the cytosol or plasma membrane (Deane et al, 2001; Craige et al, 2010; Garcia-Gonzalo et al, 2011; Ye et al, 2014; Joo et al, 2013; reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Hsiao et al, 2012; Reiter et al, 2012). In addition to the transition fibres, the transition zone also consists of the ciliary necklace (a row of protein particles at the ciliary membrane at the base of the cilium) and the Y-links (that connect the axonemal microtubules to the membrane at the ciliary necklace) (Williams et al, 2011; reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012; Reiter et al, 2012).",NA,

In addition, the cilium is a dynamic structure, and the axoneme is continually being remodeled by addition and removal of tubulin at the distal tip (Marshall and Rosenbaum, 2001; Stephens, 1997; Song et al, 2001). As a result, the function and structure of this organelle relies on the directed trafficking of protein and vesicles to the cilium. Small GTPases of the RAS, RAB, ARF and ARL families are involved in cytoskeletal organization and membrane traffic and are required to regulate the traffic from the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network to the cilium (reviewed in Deretic, 2013; Li et al, 2012). ARF4 is a Golgi-resident GTPase that acts in conjunction with a ciliary-targeting complex consisting?of the ARF-GAP ASAP1, RAB11A, the RAB11 effector FIP3 and the RAB8A guanine nucleotide exchange factor RAB3IP/RABIN8 to target cargo bearing a putative C-terminal VxPx targeting motif to the cilium. A well-studied example of this system involves the trafficking of rhodopsin to the retinal rod photoreceptors, a specialized form of the cilium (reviewed in Deretic, 2013). ARL3, ARL13B and ARL6 are all small ARF-like GTPases with assorted roles in ciliary trafficking and maintenance. Studies in C. elegans suggest that ARL3 and ARL13B have opposing roles in maintaining the stability of the anterograde IFT trains in the cilium (Li et al, 2010). In addition, both ARL3 and ARL13B have roles in facilitating the traffic of subsets of ciliary cargo to the cilium. Myristoylated cargo such as peripheral membrane protein Nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3) is targeted to the cilium in a UNC119- and ARL3-dependent manner, while ARL13B is required for the PDE6-dependent ciliary localization of INPP5E (Wright et al, 2011; Humbert et al, 2012; reviewed in Li et al, 2012). ARL6 was also identified as BBS3, a gene that when mutated gives rise to the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). ARL6 acts upstream of a complex of 8 other BBS-associated proteins known as the BBSome. ARL6 and the BBSome are required for the ciliary targeting of proteins including the melanin concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR) and the somatostatin receptor (SSTR3), among others (Nachury et al, 2007; Loktev et al, 2008; Jin et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011). Both the BBSome and ARL6 may continue to be associated with cargo inside the cilium, as they are observed to undergo typical IFT movements along the axoneme",NA,
Homo sapiens,R-HSA-5620971,Pyroptosis,Programmed Cell Death,Reactome,"Version 81, 2022",5,HMDB0004249,"Pyroptosis is a form of lytic inflammatory programmed cell death that is triggered by microbial infection or pathological stimuli, such as stroke or cancer (reviewed in Shi J et al. 2017; Man SM et al. 2017; Tang D et al. 2019; Zheng Z & Li G 2020). The process of pyroptosis protects the host from microbial infection but can also lead to pathological inflammation if overactivated. The morphologic characteristics of pyroptosis include cell swelling, rupture of the cell membrane and release of intracellular contents into the extracellular environment. Pyroptosis is also characterized by chromatin condensation, however this is not the key or universal feature of pyroptosis (reviewed in Man SM et al. 2017; Tang D et al. 2019). Pyroptosis is executed by proteins of the gasdermin family, which mediate formation of membrane pores (Liu X et al. 2016; Ding J et al. 2016; Mulvihill E et al. 2018; Broz P et al. 2020). Pyroptosis can be defined as gasdermin-mediated programmed necrotic cell death (Shi?J et al. 2017; Galluzzi L et al. 2018). The gasdermin (GSDM) superfamily includes GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, GSDME (or DFNA5) and PJVK (DFNB59) (Kovacs SB & Miao EA 2018). Each protein contains an N-terminal domain with intrinsic necrotic pore-forming activity and a C?terminal domain reported to inhibit cell death through intramolecular domain association (Liu X et al. 2016; Ding J et al. 2016; Liu Z et al. 2018, 2019; Kuang S et al. 2017). Proteolytic cleavage in the linker connecting the N? and C?terminal domains of gasdermins releases the C?terminus, allowing the gasdermin N?terminus to translocate to the cell membrane and oligomerize to form pores (Shi J et al. 2015; Ding J et al. 2016; Sborgi L et al. 2016; Feng S et al. 2018; Yang J et al. 2018; Mulvihill E et al. 2018). Although PJVK (DFNB59) is included to the gasdermin family, it is not known whether PJVK is cleaved and whether the full length or the N-terminal portion of PJVK is responsible for forming membrane pores. The N?terminal fragments of GSDMs strongly bind to phosphatidylinositol phosphates and weakly to phosphatidylserine, found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Liu X et al. 2016; Ding J et al. 2016; Mulvihill E et al. 2018). Gasdermins are also able to target cardiolipin, which is often found in mitochondrial membranes and membranes of bacteria (Liu X et al. 2016; Rogers C et al. 2019). The size of the GSDMD pore is estimated to be 10¨C20 nm (Ding J et al. 2016; Sborgi L et al. 2016). The pore?forming activity of GSDMs in the cell membrane facilitates the release of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)?1¦Â and IL?18 (mainly in GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis), and eventually leads to cytolysis in mammalian cells, releasing additional proinflammatory cellular contents including danger signals such as high mobility group box?1 (HMGB1) (Shi J et al. 2015; He W et al. 2015; Evavold CL et al. 2017; Semino C et al. 2018; Volchuk A et al. 2020). Pyroptosis can occur in immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and non?immune cell types such as intestinal epithelial cells, trophoblasts and hepatocytes (Taabazuing CY et al. 2017; Li H et al. 2019; Jia C et al. 2019). GSDME can be cleaved by caspase?3 (CASP3) to induce pyroptosis downstream of the ¡°apoptotic¡± machinery (Wang Y et al. 2017; Rogers C et al. 2017), whereas GSDMD is cleaved by inflammatory CASP1, CASP4 and CASP5 in humans, and CASP1, CASP11 in mice to induce pyroptosis associated with inflammasome activation (Shi J et al. 2015; Kayagaki N et al. 2015). CASP3 cleavage of GSDMD results in its inactivation (Taabazuing et al. 2017). In mouse macrophages, CASP8 can also cleave GSDMD and cause pyroptosis when TAK1 is inhibited (Malireddi R et al. 2018; Orning P et al. 2018; Sarhan J et al. 2018), and TAK1 inhibition also leads to GSDME cleavage (Sarhan J et al. 2018). Furthermore, activated CASP8 can drive inflammasome-independent cleavage of both pro-IL-1¦Â and GSDMD downstream of the extrinsic cell death receptor signaling pathway switching apoptotic signaling to GSDMD-dependent pyroptotic-like cell death (Donado CA et al. 2020). The cleavage and activation of GSDMD in neutrophils is mediated by neutrophil elastase (NE or ELANE), which is released from azurophil granules into the cytosol during neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (Kambara H et al. 2018). Further, granzyme A (GZMA) released from cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells specifically target GSDMB for interdomain cleavage to activate GSDMB-dependent pyroptosis in target tumor cells (Zhou Z et al. 2020). Similarly, granzyme B (GZMB) released from cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, can induce GSDME?dependent lytic cell death in tumor targets via the CASP3?mediated cleavage of GSDME (Zhang Z et al. 2020).This Reactome module describes pyroptotic activities of GSDMD and GSDME. While the N?terminal domains of mammalian GSDMA, GSDMB, and GSDMC also have the ability to form pores (Feng S et al. 2018; Ruan J et al. 2018), their functions in the induction of pyroptosis, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines or in bactericidal activity in host remain to be studied and are not covered by this Reactome module.",NA,

PDPK1 phosphorylates PKNs on a highly conserved threonine residue in the kinase activation loop, which is a prerequisite for PKN activation.

IQGAPs bind F-actin filaments via the CH domain and modulate cell shape and motility through regulation of G-actin/F-actin equilibrium (Brill et al. 1996, Fukata et al. 1997, Bashour et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2007, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Binding?of IQGAPs to F-actin is inhibited by calmodulin binding to the IQ repeats (Bashour et al. 1997, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Based on IQGAP1 studies, IQGAPs presumably function as homodimers (Bashour et al. 1997).IQGAP1 is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions through its interaction with E-cadherin (CDH1) and catenins (CTTNB1 and CTTNA1) (Kuroda et al. 1998, Hage et al. 2009). IQGAP1 contributes to cell polarity and lamellipodia formation through its interaction with microtubules (Fukata et al. 2002, Suzuki and Takahashi 2008).",NA,

The PH domain inhibits the kinase activity of ROCKs by an intramolecular fold. ROCKs are activated by binding of the GTP-bound RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB and RHOC to the RHO binding domain of ROCKs (Ishizaki et al. 1996, Leung et al. 1996), which disrupts the autoinhibitory fold. Once activated, ROCK1 and ROCK2 phosphorylate target proteins, many of which are involved in the stabilization of actin filaments and generation of actin-myosin contractile force. ROCKs phosphorylate LIM kinases LIMK1 and LIMK2, enabling LIMKs to phosphorylate cofilin, an actin depolymerizing factor, and thereby regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Ohashi et al. 2000, Sumi et al. 2001). ROCKs phosphorylate MRLC (myosin regulatory light chain), which stimulates the?activity of non-muscle myosin II (NMM2), an actin-based motor protein involved in cell migration, polarity formation and cytokinesis (Amano et al. 1996, Riento and Ridley 2003, Watanabe et al. 2007, Amano et al. 2010). ROCKs also phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) of MLC phosphatase, inhibiting the phosphatase activity and preventing dephosphorylation of MRLC. This pathway acts synergistically with phosphorylation of MRLC by ROCKs towards stimulation of non-muscle myosin II activity (Kimura et al. 1996, Amano et al. 2010).",NA,

All PAKs share a conserved catalytic domain located at the carboxyl terminus and a highly conserved motif in the amino terminus known as p21-binding domain (PBD) or Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. There are six mammalian PAKs that can be divided into two classes: class I (or conventional) PAKs (PAK1-3) and class II PAKs (PAK4-6). Conventional PAKs are important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility and are additionally implicated in transcription through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades, death and survival signaling and cell cycle progression (Chan and Manser 2012).PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3 are direct effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases. RAC1 and CDC42 bind to the CRIB domain. This binding induces a conformational change that disrupts inactive PAK homodimers and relieves autoinhibition of the catalytic carboxyl terminal domain?(Manser et al. 1994, Manser et al. 1995, Zhang et al. 1998, Lei et al. 2000, Parrini et al. 2002; reviewed by Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009). Autophosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the catalytic domain of PAKs (T423 in PAK1, T402 in PAK2 and T436 in PAK3) is necessary for the kinase activity of PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3. Autophosphorylation of PAK1 serine residue S144, PAK2 serine residue S141, and PAK3 serine residue S154 disrupts association of PAKs with RAC1 or CDC42 and enhances kinase activity (Lei et al. 2000, Chong et al. 2001, Parrini et al. 2002, Jung and Traugh 2005, Wang et al. 2011). LIMK1 is one of the downstream targets of PAK1 and is activated through PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of the threonine residue T508 within its activation loop (Edwards et al. 1999). Further targets are the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), filamin, cortactin, p41Arc (a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex), caldesmon, paxillin and RhoGDI, to mention a few (Szczepanowska 2009).Class II PAKs also have a CRIB domain, but lack a defined autoinhibitory domain and proline-rich regions. They do not require GTPases for their kinase activity, but their interaction with RAC or CDC42 affects their subcellular localization. Only conventional PAKs will be annotated here.",NA,

TP53 regulates transcription of many genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and amino acids, protein synthesis and aerobic respiration.TP53 stimulates transcription of TIGAR, a D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. TIGAR activity decreases glycolytic rate and lowers ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels in cells (Bensaad et al. 2006). TP53 may also negatively regulate the rate of glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 (Kondoh et al. 2005, Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al. 2004, Kawauchi et al. 2008).TP53 negatively regulates several key points in PI3K/AKT signaling and downstream mTOR signaling, decreasing the rate of protein synthesis and, hence, cellular growth. TP53 directly stimulates?transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which acts to inhibit PI3K-mediated activation of AKT (Stambolic et al. 2001). TP53 stimulates transcription of sestrin genes, SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3 (Velasco-Miguel et al. 1999, Budanov et al. 2002, Brynczka et al. 2007). One of sestrin functions may be to reduce and reactivate overoxidized peroxiredoxin PRDX1, thereby reducing ROS levels (Budanov et al. 2004, Papadia et al. 2008, Essler et al. 2009). Another function of sestrins is to bind the activated AMPK complex and protect it from AKT-mediated inactivation. By enhancing AMPK activity, sestrins negatively regulate mTOR signaling (Budanov and Karin 2008, Cam et al. 2014). The expression of DDIT4 (REDD1), another negative regulator of mTOR signaling, is directly stimulated by TP63 and TP53. DDIT4 prevents AKT-mediated inactivation of TSC1:TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting mTOR cascade (Cam et al. 2014, Ellisen et al. 2002, DeYoung et al. 2008). TP53 may also be involved, directly or indirectly, in regulation of expression of other participants of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, such as PIK3CA (Singh et al. 2002), TSC2 and AMPKB (Feng et al. 2007). TP53 regulates mitochondrial metabolism through several routes. TP53 stimulates transcription of SCO2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (Matoba et al. 2006). TP53 stimulates transcription of RRM2B gene, which encodes a subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase complex, responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA content in the cell (Tanaka et al. 2000, Bourdon et al. 2007, Kulawiec et al. 2009). TP53 also transactivates mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded gene important for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and maintenance (Park et al. 2009). Finally, TP53 stimulates transcription of the mitochondrial glutaminase GLS2, leading to increased mitochondrial respiration rate and reduced ROS levels (Hu et al. 2010). The great majority of tumor cells generate energy through aerobic glycolysis, rather than the much more efficient aerobic mitochondrial respiration, and this metabolic change is known as the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956). Since the majority of tumor cells have impaired TP53 function, and TP53 regulates a number of genes involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, it is likely that TP53 inactivation plays an important role in the metabolic derangement of cancer cells such as the Warburg effect and the concomitant increased tumorigenicity (reviewed by Feng and Levine 2010). On the other hand, some mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni syndrome may result in the retention of its wild-type metabolic activities while losing cell cycle and apoptosis functions (Wang et al. 2013). Consistent with such human data, some mutations of p53, unlike p53 null state, retain the ability to regulate energy metabolism while being inactive in regulating its classic gene targets involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence. Retention of metabolic and antioxidant functions of p53 protects p53 mutant mice from early onset tumorigenesis (Li et al. 2012)",NA,

In addition to post-translational modifications, the activity of TP53 is also regulated by binding of transcription co-factors.In unstressed cells, TP53 protein levels are low due to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of TP53, which triggers proteasome-mediated degradation. In response to stress, TP53 undergoes stabilizing phosphorylation, mainly at serine residues S15 and S20. Several different kinases can phosphorylate TP53 at these sites, but the main S15 kinases are considered to be ATM and ATR, while the main S20 kinases are considered to be CHEK2 and CHEK1. Additional phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 promotes transcription of pro-apoptotic, rather than?cell cycle arrest genes.Acetylation mainly has a positive impact on transcriptional activity of TP53, while methylation can both positively and negatively regulate TP53.Some posttranslational modifications regulate interaction of TP53 with transcriptional co-factors, some of which are themselves transcriptional targets of TP53.For review of the complex network of TP53 regulation, please refer to Kruse and Gu 2009, and Meek and Anderson 2009.",NA,

The majority of apoptotic genes that are transcriptional targets of TP53 promote apoptosis, but there are also several TP53 target genes that inhibit apoptosis, providing cells with an opportunity to attempt to repair the damage and/or recover from stress. Pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets of TP53 involve TRAIL death receptors TNFRSF10A (DR4), TNFRSF10B (DR5), TNFRSF10C (DcR1) and TNFRSF10D (DcR2), as well as the FASL/CD95L death receptor FAS (CD95). TRAIL receptors and FAS induce pro-apoptotic signaling in response to external stimuli via extrinsic apoptosis pathway (Wu et al. 1997, Takimoto et al. 2000, Guan et al. 2001, Liu et al. 2004, Ruiz de Almodovar et al. 2004, Liu et al. 2005, Schilling et al. 2009, Wilson et al. 2013). IGFBP3 is a transcriptional target of TP53 that may serve as a ligand for a novel?death receptor TMEM219 (Buckbinder et al. 1995, Ingermann et al. 2010).TP53 regulates expression of a number of genes involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggered by the cellular stress. Some of TP53 targets, such as BAX, BID, PMAIP1 (NOXA), BBC3 (PUMA) and probably BNIP3L, AIFM2, STEAP3, TRIAP1 and TP53AIP1, regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and/or cytochrome C release (Miyashita and Reed 1995, Oda et al. 2000, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Nakano and Vousden 2001, Sax et al. 2002, Passer et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Li et al. 2004, Fei et al. 2004, Wu et al. 2004, Park and Nakamura 2005, Patel et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2013). Other pro-apoptotic genes, either involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, extrinsic apoptosis pathway or pyroptosis (inflammation-related cell death), which are transcriptionally regulated by TP53 are cytosolic caspase activators, such as APAF1, PIDD1, and NLRC4, and caspases themselves, such as CASP1, CASP6 and CASP10 (Lin et al. 2000, Robles et al. 2001, Gupta et al. 2001, MacLachlan and El-Deiry 2002, Rikhof et al. 2003, Sadasivam et al. 2005, Brough and Rothwell 2007).It is uncertain how exactly some of the pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as TP53I3 (PIG3), RABGGTA, BCL2L14, BCL6, NDRG1 and PERP contribute to apoptosis (Attardi et al. 2000, Guo et al. 2001, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Contente et al. 2002, Ihrie et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Stein et al. 2004, Phan and Dalla-Favera 2004, Jen and Cheung 2005, Margalit et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2007, Saito et al. 2009, Davies et al. 2009, Giam et al. 2012).TP53 is stabilized in response to cellular stress by phosphorylation on at least serine residues S15 and S20. Since TP53 stabilization precedes the activation of cell death genes, the TP53 tetramer phosphorylated at S15 and S20 is shown as a regulator of pro-apoptotic/pro-cell death genes. Some pro-apoptotic TP53 target genes, such as TP53AIP1, require additional phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 (Oda et al. 2000, Taira et al. 2007). Phosphorylation of TP53 at S46 is regulated by another TP53 pro-apoptotic target, TP53INP1 (Okamura et al. 2001, Tomasini et al. 2003). Additional post-translational modifications of TP53 may be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes presented in this pathway and this information will be included as evidence becomes available.Activation of some pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as BAX, FAS, BBC3 (PUMA) and TP53I3 (PIG3) requires the presence of the complex of TP53 and an ASPP protein, either PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Patel et al. 2008, Wilson et al. 2013), indicating how the interaction with specific co-factors modulates the cellular response/outcome.TP53 family members TP63 and or TP73 can also activate some of the pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as FAS, BAX, BBC3 (PUMA), TP53I3 (PIG3), CASP1 and PERP (Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Jain et al. 2005, Ihrie et al. 2005, Patel et al. 2008, Schilling et al. 2009, Celardo et al. 2013).

Recently, however, somatically arising mutations in the FGFR4 coding sequence have begun to be identified in some cancers. 8% of rhabdomyosarcomas have activating mutations in the kinase domain of FGFR4. Two of these mutations - N535K (paralogous to the FGFR2 N550K allele found in endometrial cancers) and V550E - have been shown to support the oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (Taylor, 2009). An FGFR4 Y367C mutation has also been identified in breast cancers (Ruhe, 2007; Roidl, 2010); mutations of paralogous residues in FGFR2 and FGFR3 are associated with both skeletal dysplasias and the development of diverse cancers (Pollock, 2007; Ruhe, 2007; Rousseau, 1996; Chesi, 1997, 2001).Finally, a SNP at position 388 of FGFR4 is associated with aggressive disease development.

Point mutations in the Ig II-III linker analagous to the P252R Pfeiffer syndrome mutation have been identified in lung cancer and melanoma (Ruhe, 2007; Davies, 2005), and two kinase-domain mutations in FGFR1 have been identified in glioblastoma (Rand, 2005, Network TCGA, 2008).In contrast, FGFR1 is a target of chromosomal rearrangements in a number of cancers. FGFR1 has been shown to be recurrently translocated in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS), a pre-leukemic condition also known as stem cell leukemia/lymphoma (SCLL) that rapidly progresses to leukemia. This translocation fuses the kinase domain of FGFR1 with the dimerization domain of one of 10 identified fusion partners, resulting in the constitutive dimerization and activation of the kinase (reviewed in Jackson, 2010). Amplification of the FGFR1 gene has been implicated as a oncogenic factor in a range of cancers, including breast, ovarian, bladder, lung, oral squamous carcinomas, and rhabdomyosarcoma (reviewed in Turner and Grose, 2010; Wesche, 2011; Greulich and Pollock, 2011), although there are other candidate genes in the amplified region and the definitive role of FGFR1 has not been fully established.More recently, FGFR1 fusion proteins have been identified in a number of cancers; these are thought to undergo constitutive ligand-independent dimerization and activation based on dimerization motifs found in the fusion partners (reviewed in Parker, 2014)",NA,

Activating mutations in FGFR3 are associated with the development of a range of skeletal dysplasias that result in dwarfism (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Burke et al, 1998; Harada et al, 2009). The most common form of human dwarfism is achondroplasia (ACH), which is caused by mutations G380R and G375C in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 that are thought to promote ligand-independent dimerization (Rousseau et al, 1994; Shiang et al, 1994; Bellus et al, 1995a) Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a milder form dwarfism that is the result of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR3 (Bellus et al, 1995b). Two neonatal lethal conditions, thanatophoric dysplasia type I and II (TDI and TDII) are also the result of mutations in FGFR3; TDI arises from a range of mutations that either result in the formation of unpaired cysteine residues in the extracellular region that promote aberrant ligand-independent dimerization or by mutations that introduce stop codons (Rousseau et al, 1995; Rousseau et al, 1996, D'Avis et al,1998). A single mutation, K650E in the second tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR3 is responsible for all identified cases of TDII (Tavormina et al, 1995a, b). Other missense mutations at the same K650 residue give rise to Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Disorders and Acanthosis Nigricans (SADDAN) syndrome (Tavormina et al, 1999; Bellus et al, 1999). The severity of the phenotype arising from many of the activating FGFR3 mutations has recently been shown to correlate with the extent to which the mutations activate the receptor (Naski et al, 1996; Bellus et al, 2000)

In addition to mutations that cause dwarfism syndromes, a Pro250Arg mutation in the conserved dipeptide between the IgII and IgIII domains has been identified in an atypical craniosynostosis condition (Bellus et al, 1996; Reardon et al, 1997). This mutation, which is paralogous to mutations seen in FGFR1 and 2 in Pfeiffer and Apert Syndrome, respectively, results in an increase in ligand-binding affinity for the receptor (Ibrahimi et al, 2004b).


Of all the FGF receptors, FGFR3 has perhaps the best established link to the development in cancer. 50% of bladder cancers have somatic mutations in the coding sequence of FGFR3; of these, more than half occur in the extracellular region at a single position (S249C) (Cappellen et al, 1999; Naski et al, 1996; di Martino et al, 2009, Sibley et al, 2001). Activating mutations are also seen in the juxta- and trans-membrane domains, as well as in the kinase domain (reviewed in Weshe et al, 2011). As is the case for the other receptors, many of the activating mutations that are seen in FGFR3-related cancers mimic the germline FGFR3 mutations that give rise to autosomal skeletal disorders and include both ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms (reviewed in Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Burke et al, 1998). In addition to activating mutations, the FGFR3 gene is subject to a translocation event in 15% of multiple myelomas (Avet-Loiseau et al, 1998; Chesi et al, 1997). This chromosomal rearrangement puts the FGFR3 gene under the control of the highly active IGH promoter and promotes overexpression and constitutive activation of FGFR3. In a small proportion of multiple myelomas, the translocation event is accompanied by activating mutations in the FGFR3 coding sequence (Chesi et al, 1997).

More recently, a number of fusion proteins of FGFR3 have been identified in various cancers (Singh et al, 2012; Williams et al, 2013; Parker et al, 2013; Wu et al, 2013; Wang et al, 2014; Yuan et al, 2014; reviewed in Parker et al, 2014). The most common fusion protein is TACC3, a coiled coil protein involved in mitotic spindle assembly. FGFR3 fusion proteins are constitutively active and appear to contribute to proliferation and tumorigenesis through activation of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways (reviewed in Parker et al, 2014).",NA,

POLK and POLZ cooperate in the elongation of nucleotides inserted opposite to lesioned bases by POLK.

POLI contains a PIP box and two UBMs (ubiquitin binding motifs) that are responsible for POLI binding to monoubiquitinated PCNA (MonoUb:K164-PCNA) (Bienko et al. 2005, Haracska et al. 2005, Bomar et al. 2010).

The elongation step is performed by the polymerase zeta complex (POLZ), composed of REV3L and MAD2L2 subunits (Johnson et al. 2000).

Melanosomes are transferred via dendrites to surrounding keratinocytes. Keratinocytes and melanocytes are collectively known as 'the epidermal melanin unit'. Each melanocyte is in contact with approximately 40 keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers (Cichorek et al. 2013). Melanocytes are distributed in the epidermis, hair follicles, the inner ear and the eye (Yamaguchi et al. 2007, Tolleson 2005). Melanocytes in mammals and birds produce two chemically distinct types of melanin, black to brown eumelanin and yellow to reddish-brown pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2008, Simon et al. 2009, d'Ischia et al. 2013). These differ in their responses to UV radiation; eumelanin has the ability to convert absorbed light energy into heat energy (Meredith & Riesz 2004) and to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bustamante et al. 1993), while pheomelanin is?a phototoxic pro-oxidant (Samokhvalov 2005). Most natural melanin pigments contain eumelanin and pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2003) and are termed 'mixed' melanins. Neuromelanins are mixed melanin-like pigments which are mainly found in neurons of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus (Fedorow et al. 2005). Synthesis of NM may prevent the accumulation of toxic catechol derivatives (Zecca et al. 2003). NM can sequester a variety of potentially damaging molecules such as beta-carbolines, heavy metal ions and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (D'Amato et al. 1986), a drug which causes Parkinson's Disease-like symptoms. Models suggest that mixed melanogenesis occurs in three stages (Ito et al. 2000). The initial stage of melanin biosynthesis is the production of cysteinyldopas, which continues while sufficient cysteine is available. The second stage is the oxidation of cysteinyldopas to produce pheomelanin, which continues while cysteinyldopa concentration is sufficiently high. The last stage is the production of eumelanin, which begins when cysteinyldopas and cysteine are depleted. The ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin is determined by tyrosinase activity and the availability of tyrosine and cysteine (Land et al. 2003)",NA,

Formins are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Many but not all formin family members are activated by RHO GTPases. Formins that serve as effectors of RHO GTPases belong to different formin subfamilies but they all share a structural similarity to Drosophila protein diaphanous and are hence named diaphanous-related formins (DRFs).DRFs activated by RHO GTPases contain a GTPase binding domain (GBD) at their N-terminus, followed by formin homology domains 3, 1, and 2 (FH3, FH1, FH2) and a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) at the C-terminus. Most DRFs contain a dimerization domain (DD) and a coiled-coil region (CC) in between FH3 and FH1 domains (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014). RHO GTPase-activated DRFs are autoinhibited through the interaction between FH3 and DAD which is disrupted upon binding to an active RHO GTPase (Li and Higgs 2003, Lammers et al. 2005, Nezami et al. 2006).?Since formins dimerize, it is not clear whether the FH3-DAD interaction is intra- or intermolecular. FH2 domain is responsible for binding to the F-actin and contributes to the formation of head-to-tail formin dimers (Xu et al. 2004). The proline-rich FH1 domain interacts with the actin-binding proteins profilins, thereby facilitating actin recruitment to formins and accelerating actin polymerization (Romero et al. 2004, Kovar et al. 2006).Different formins are activated by different RHO GTPases in different cell contexts. FMNL1 (formin-like protein 1) is activated by binding to the RAC1:GTP and is involved in the formation of lamellipodia in macrophages (Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al. 2000) and is involved in the regulation of the Golgi complex structure (Colon-Franco et al. 2011). Activation of FMNL1 by CDC42:GTP contributes to the formation of the phagocytic cup (Seth et al. 2006). Activation of FMNL2 (formin-like protein 2) and FMNL3 (formin-like protein 3) by RHOC:GTP is involved in cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Kitzing et al. 2010, Vega et al. 2011). DIAPH1, activated by RHOA:GTP, promotes elongation of actin filaments and activation of SRF-mediated transcription which is inhibited by unpolymerized actin (Miralles et al. 2003). RHOF-mediated activation of DIAPH1 is implicated in formation of stress fibers (Fan et al. 2010). Activation of DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 by RHOB:GTP leads to actin coat formation around endosomes and regulates endosome motility and trafficking (Fernandez-Borja et al. 2005, Wallar et al. 2007). Endosome trafficking is also regulated by DIAPH2 transcription isoform 3 (DIAPH2-3) which, upon activation by RHOD:GTP, recruits SRC kinase to endosomes (Tominaga et al. 2000, Gasman et al. 2003). DIAPH2 transcription isoform 2 (DIAPH2-2) is involved in mitosis where, upon being activated by CDC42:GTP, it facilitates the capture of astral microtubules by kinetochores (Yasuda et al. 2004, Cheng et al. 2011).

Although CRAF (also known as RAF-1) was the first identified and remains perhaps the best studied, BRAF is most similar to the RAF expressed in other organisms. Notably, MAPK (ERK) activation is more compromised in BRAF-deficient cells than in CRAF or ARAF deficient cells (Bonner et al, 1985; Mikula et al, 2001, Huser et al, 2001, Mercer et al, 2002; reviewed in Leicht et al, 2007; Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014). Consistent with its important role in MAPK pathway activation, mutations in the BRAF gene, but not in those for A- or CRAF, are associated with cancer development (Davies et al, 2002; reviewed in Leicht et al, 2007). ARAF and CRAF may have arisen through gene duplication events, and may play additional roles in MAPK-independent signaling (Hindley and Kolch, 2002; Murakami and Morrison, 2001).Despite divergences in function, all mammalian RAF proteins share?three conserved regions (CRs) and each interacts with RAS and MEK proteins, although with different affinities. The N-terminal CR1 contains a RAS-binding domain (RBD) and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that mediate interactions with RAS and the phospholipid membrane. CR2 contains inhibitory phosphorylation sites that impact RAS binding and RAF activation, while the C-terminal CR3 contains the bi-lobed kinase domain with its activation loop, and an adjacent upstream ""N-terminal acidic motif"" -S(S/G)YY in C- and A-RAF,respectively, and SSDD in B-RAF - that is required for RAF activation (Tran et al, 2005; Dhillon et al, 2002; Chong et al, 2001; Cutler et al, 1998; Chong et al, 2003; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).Regulation of RAF activity involves multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, intramolecular conformational changes, homo- and heterodimerization between RAF monomers and changes to protein binding partners, including scaffolding proteins which bring pathway members together (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014). The details of this regulation are not completely known and differ slightly from one RAF isoform to another. Briefly, in the inactive state, RAF phosphorylation on conserved serine residues in CR2 promote an interaction with 14-3-3 dimers, maintaining the kinase in a closed conformation. Upon RAS activation, these sites are dephosphorylated, allowing the RAF CRD and RBD to bind RAS and phospholipids, facilitating membrane recruitment. RAF activation requires homo- or heterodimerization, which promotes autophosphorylation in the activation loop of the receiving monomer. Of the three isoforms, only BRAF is able to initiate this allosteric activation of other RAF monomers (Hu et al, 2013; Heidorn et al, 2010; Garnett et al, 2005). This activity depends on negative charge in the N-terminal acidic region (NtA; S(S/G)YY or SSDD) adjacent to the kinase domain. In BRAF, this region carries permanent negative charge due to the presence of the two aspartate residues in place of the tyrosine residues of A- and CRAF. In addition, unique to BRAF, one of the serine residues of the NtA is constitutively phosphorylated. In A- and CRAF, residues in this region are subject to phosphorylation by activated MEK downstream of RAF activation, establishing a positive feedback loop and allowing activated A- and CRAF monomers to act as transactivators in turn (Hu et al, 2013; reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014). RAF signaling is terminated through dephosphorylation of the NtA region and phosphorylation of the residues that mediate the inhibitory interaction with 14-3-3, promoting a return to the inactive state (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014).",NA,

Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades. GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004). Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012). Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this,?a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011). Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location. Temporal and spatial specificity of the cascade is achieved in part through the interaction of pathway components with numerous scaffolding proteins (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007; Brown and Sacks, 2009). The importance of the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is highlighted by the fact that components of this pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers. Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF (Roberts and Der, 2007; Davies et al, 2002; Cantwell-Dorris et al, 2011).",NA,

Phosphorylation of the MAPK2K activation loop primes them to phosphorylate the primary effector of the activated MAPK pathway, the two MAPK proteins MAPK3 and MAPK1 (also known as ERK1 and 2).

Activated RAF proteins are subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation that promotes the subsequent dephosphorylation of the activation loop and NtA region, terminating RAF kinase activity. This dephosphorylation, catalyzed by PP2A and PP5, primes the RAF proteins for PKA or AKT-mediated phosphorylation of residues S259 and S621, restoring the 14-3-3 binding sites and returning the RAF proteins to the inactive state (von Kriegsheim et al, 2006; Dougherty et al, 2005; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).

Although cells have mechanisms to destroy ROS and repair the damage caused by ROS, it is considered to be a major factor in age-related diseases and the ageing process (Zhang & Weissbach 2008, Kim et al. 2014). ROS-scavenging systems include enzymes such as peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, catalases and glutathione peroxidases exist to minimise the potential damage. ROS reactions can also cause specific modifications to amino acid side chains that result in structural changes to proteins/enzymes. Methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) can be oxidised by ROS to sulfoxide and further oxidised to sulfone derivatives. Both free Met and protein-based Met are readily oxidized to form methionine sulphoxide (MetO) (Brot & Weissbach 1991). Many proteins have been demonstrated to undergo such oxidation and as a consequence have?altered function (Levine et al. 2000). Sulphoxide formation can be reversed by the action of the methionine sulphoxide reductase system (MSR) which catalyses the reduction of MetO to Met (Brot et al. 1981). This repair uses one ROS equivalent, so MSR proteins can act as catalytic antioxidants, removing ROS (Levine et al. 1996). Methionine oxidation results in a mixture of methionine (S)-S- and (R)-S-oxides of methionine, diastereomers which are reduced by MSRA and MSRB, respectively. MSRA can reduce both free and protein-based methionine-(S)-S-oxide, whereas MSRB is specific for protein-based methionine-(R)-S-oxide. Mammals typically have only one gene encoding MSRA, but at least three genes encoding MSRBs (Hansel et al. 2005). Although structurally distinct, MRSA and MRSB share a common three-step catalytic mechanism. In the first step, the MSR catalytic cysteine residue interacts with the MetO substrate, which leads to product release and formation of the sulfenic acid. In the second step, an intramolecular disulfide bridge is formed between the catalytic cysteine and the regenerating cysteine. In the final step, the disulfide bridge is reduced by an electron donor, the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin/TR system, leading to the regeneration of the MSR active site (Boschi-Muller et al. 2008).Beta-linked isoaspartyl (isoAsp) peptide bonds can arise spontaneously via succinimide-linked deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or dehydration of aspartate (Asp). Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1, PIMT EC 2.1.1.77) transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the alpha side-chain carboxyl group of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartatyl amino acids. The resulting methyl ester undergoes spontaneous transformation to L-succinimide, which spontaneously hydrolyses to generates L-aspartyl residues or L-isoaspartyl residues (Knorre et al. 2009).

The MAPK kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), at the top of the cascade, is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in response to external stimuli; this phosphorylation often occurs in the context of an interaction between the MAPKKK protein and a member of the RAS/RHO family of small GTP-binding proteins. Activated MAPKKK proteins in turn phosphorylate the dual-specificity MAPK kinase proteins (MAPKK), which ultimately phosphorylate the MAPK proteins?in a conserved Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop. Less is known about the activation of the atypical families of MAPKs, which include the ERK3/4 signaling cascade, the ERK7 cascade and the NLK cascade.

Type I epithelial cells form the alveolar surface and mediate gaseous exchange. Type II epithelial cells secrete pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex that forms a thin interfacial film, lowering surface tension at the air-liquid interface in alveoli and maintaining the structural integrity of alveoli, preventing their collapse at low volumes (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013). Surfactant production is increased prior to birth, in preparation for air breathing at birth (Hallman 2013). Pre-term infants, where type II epithelial cells are not fully differentiated yet, can produce insufficient surfactant and result in respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant is composed primarily of phospholipids enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013) and the pulmonary collectins,?termed surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SFTPA-D). They influence surfactant homeostasis, contributing to the physical structures of lipids in the alveoli and to the regulation of surfactant function and metabolism. They are directly secreted from alveolar type II cells into the airway to function as part of the surfactant. SFTPA and D are large, hydrophilic proteins while SFTPB and C are small, very hydrophobic proteins (Johansson et al. 1994).

Following ATM activation and foci formation, the two-step resection is initiated by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP) associated with BRCA1:BARD1, and completed by EXO1 or DNA2 in cooperation with DNA helicases BLM, WRN and BRIP1 (BACH1) (Sartori et al. 2007, Yun and Hiom 2009, Eid et al. 2010, Nimonkar et al. 2011, Suhasini et al. 2011, Sturzenegger et al. 2014). Long 3'-ssDNA overhangs produced by extensive resection are coated by the RPA heterotrimer (RPA1:RPA2:RPA3), triggering ATR signaling. ATR signaling is needed for SSA, probably because of the related phosphorylation of RPA2 (Zou and Elledge 2003, Anantha et al. 2007, Liu et al. 2012).RAD52 is the key?mediator of SSA. Activated ATM phosphorylates and activates ABL1, and activated ABL1 subsequently phosphorylates pre-formed RAD52 heptameric rings, increasing their affinity for ssDNA (Honda et al. 2011). Phosphorylated RAD52 binds phosphorylated RPA heterotrimers on 3'-ssDNA overhangs at resected DNA DSBs. RAD52 also binds RAD51 and prevents formation of invasive RAD51 nucleofilaments involved in HRR (Chen et al. 1999, Van Dyck et al. 1999, Parsons et al. 2000, Jackson et al. 2002, Singleton et al. 2002).RAD52 promotes annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs when highly homologous directed repeats are present in both 3'-ssDNA overhangs.

In a poorly studied sequence of events, POLQ promotes the annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs through microhomologous regions that are optimally 10-19 nucleotides long. Using analogy with POLB-mediated long patch base excision repair (BER), it is plausible that PARP1 (or PARP2) dimers coordinate the extension of annealed 3'-ssDNA overhangs via POLQ-mediated strand displacement synthesis with FEN1-mediated cleavage of the resulting 5'-flaps (Liang et al. 2005, Mansour et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2015, Kent et al. 2015, Ciccaldi et al. 2015, Mateos-Gomez et al. 2015). The MRN complex subsequently recruits DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) bound to XRCC1 (LIG3:XRCC1) to ligate the remaining single strand nicks (SSBs) at MMEJ sites (Della-Maria et al. 2011).Similar to single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ leads to deletion of one of the microhomology regions used for annealing and the DNA sequence in between two annealed microhomology regions. MMEJ, just like classical NHEJ, can result in genomic translocations (Ghezraoui et al. 2014). In addition, since POLQ is an error-prone DNA polymerase, MMEJ introduces frequent base substitutions (Ceccaldi et al. 2015).",NA,

These molecules are known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are immunologically silent in healthy tissues but become active upon tissue damage during both infectious and sterile insult. DAMPs are released from necrotic cells or secreted from activated cells in response to tissue damage to mediate tissue repair by promoting inflammatory responses. However, DAMPs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cancer, and atherosclerosis. The mechanism underlying the switch from DAMPs that initiate controlled tissue repair, to those that mediate chronic, uncontrolled inflammation is still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that an abnormal increase in protein citrullination is involved in disease pathophysiology (Anzilotti C et al. 2010; Sanchez-Pernaute?O et al. 2013; Sokolove J et al. 2011; Sharma P et al. 2012).

Atypical MAPK are less well characterized than their conventional counterparts, and are generally classified as such based on their lack of activation by MAPKK family members. Unlike the conventional MAPK proteins, which contain a Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop, MAPK6 and 4 have a single Ser-Glu-Gly phospho-acceptor motif (reviewed in Coulombe and Meloche, 2007; Cargnello et al, 2011). MAPK6 is also distinct in being an unstable kinase, whose turnover is mediated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Coulombe et al, 2003; Coulombe et al, 2004). The biological functions and pathways governing MAPK6 and 4 are not well established. MAPK6 and 4 are phosphorylated downstream of class I p21 activated kinases (PAKs) in a RAC- or CDC42-dependent manner (Deleris et al, 2008; Perander et al, 2008; Deleris et al, 2011; De La Mota-Peynado et al, 2011).

The atypical MAPKs also contribute to cell motility and invasiveness through the NCOA3:ETV4-dependent regulation of MMP gene expression (Long et al, 2012; Yan et al, 2008; Qin et al, 2008).

Ub conjugates linked via lysine 48 (K48) target substrates to the proteasome, whereas those linked via any of the six other Ub lysines can alter the function of the modified protein without leading to degradation. Deubiquitination, the reversal of this modification, regulates the function of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyze the removal of Ub and regulate Ub-mediated pathways.Given that Ub is covalently-linked to proteins destined to be degraded, it is a surprisingly long-lived protein in vivo (Haas & Bright 1987). This is due to the removal of Ub from its conjugates by DUBs prior to proteolysis. This may represent a quality control mechanism that prevents the degradation of proteins that were inappropriately tagged for degradation (Lam et al. 1997).?DUBs are responsible for processing inactive Ub precursors and for keeping the 26S proteasome free of unanchored Ub chains that compete for Ub-binding sites. DUBs can be grouped into five families based on their conserved catalytic domains (Amerik & Hochstrasser 2004). Four of these families are thiol proteases and comprise the bulk of DUBs, while the fifth family is a small group of Ub specific metalloproteases. Thiol protease DUBs contain a Cys-His-Asp/Asn catalytic triad in which the Asp/Asn functions to polarize and orient the His, while the His serves as a general acid/base by both priming the catalytic Cys for nucleophilic attack on the (iso)peptide carbonyl carbon and by donating a proton to the lysine epsilon-amino leaving group. The nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys on the carbonyl carbon produces a negatively charged transition state that is stabilized by an oxyanion hole composed of hydrogen bond donors. A Cys-carbonyl acyl intermediate ensues and is then hydrolyzed by nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to liberate a protein C-terminal carboxylate and regenerate the enzyme. Ub binding often causes structural rearrangements necessary for catalysis. Many DUBs are inactivated by oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to sulphenic acid (single bond SOH) (Cotto-Rios et al. 2012, Lee et al. 2013). This can be reversed by reduction with DTT or glutathione. The sulphenic acid can be irreversibly oxidized to sulphinic acid (single bond SO2H) or sulphonic acid (single bond SO3H).

DSBs also occur physiologically, during the processes of DNA replication, meiotic exchange, and V(D)J recombination.DSBs are sensed (detected) by the MRN complex. Binding of the MRN complex to the DSBs usually triggers ATM kinase activation, thus initiating the DNA double strand break response. ATM phosphorylates a number of proteins involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling, as well as proteins directly involved in the repair of DNA DSBs. DSBs are repaired via homology directed repair (HDR) or via nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ).HDR requires resection of DNA DSB ends. Resection creates 3'-ssDNA overhangs which then anneal with a homologous DNA sequence. This homologous sequence can then be used as a template for DNA repair synthesis that bridges the DSB. HDR preferably occurs through the error-free homologous?recombination repair (HRR), but can also occur through the error-prone single strand annealing (SSA), or the least accurate microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ).

DNA-PK complex recruits DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) to DNA DSB ends (Ma et al. 2002). PRKDC-mediated phosphorylation of DCLRE1C, as well as PRKDC autophosphorylation, enables DCLRE1C to trim 3'- and 5'-overhangs at DNA DSBs, preparing them for ligation (Ma et al. 2002, Ma et al. 2005, Niewolik et al. 2006). The binding of inositol phosphate may additionally stimulate the catalytic activity of PRKDC (Hanakahi et al. 2000). Other factors, such as polynucleotide kinase (PNK), TDP1 or TDP2 may remove unligatable damaged nucleotides from 5'- and 3'-ends of the DSB, converting them to ligatable substrates (Inamdar et al. 2002, Gomez-Herreros et al. 2013). DNA ligase 4 (LIG4) in complex with XRCC4 (XRCC4:LIG4) is recruited to ligatable DNA DSB ends together with the XLF (NHEJ1) homodimer and DNA polymerases mu (POLM) and/or lambda (POLL) (McElhinny et al. 2000, Hsu et al. 2002, Malu et al. 2002, Ahnesorg et al. 2006, Mahajan et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2004, Fan and Wu 2004). After POLL and/or POLM fill 1- or 2-nucleotide long single strand gaps at aligned DNA DSB ends, XRCC4:LIG4 performs the ligation of broken DNA strands, thus completing NHEJ. The presence of NHEJ1 homodimer facilitates the ligation step, especially at mismatched DSB ends (Tsai et al. 2007). Depending on other types of DNA damage present at DNA DSBs, NHEJ can result in error-free products, produce dsDNA with microdeletions and/or mismatched bases, or result in translocations (reviewed by Povrik et al. 2012).",NA,

RPA is displaced by the joint action of RAD51 and BRCA2. BRCA2 nucleates RAD51 on 3'-ssDNA overhangs, leading to formation of invasive RAD51 nucleofilaments which are stabilized by the BCDX2 complex (RAD51B:RAD51C:RAD51D:XRCC2). Stable synaptic pairing between recombining DNA molecules involves the invasion of the homologous sister chromatid duplex DNA by the RAD51 nucleofilament and base-pairing between the invading ssDNA and the complementary sister chromatid DNA strand, while the non-complementary strand of the sister chromatid DNA duplex is displaced. This results in the formation of a D-loop structure (Sung et al., 2003). PALB2 and RAD51AP1 synergistically stimulate RAD51 recombinase activity and D-loop formation. PALB2 simultaneously interacts with RAD51, BRCA2 and RAD51AP1 (Modesti et?al. 2007, Wiese et al. 2007, Buisson et al. 2010, Dray et al. 2010). PALB2 also interacts with BRCA1, and this interaction fine-tunes the localization of BRCA2 and RAD51 at DNA DSBs (Zhang et al. 2009, Sy et al. 2009). The CX3 complex, composed of RAD51C and XRCC3, binds D-loop structures through interaction with PALB2 and may be involved in the resolution of Holliday junctions (Chun et al. 2013, Park et al. 2014).While RAD52 promotes formation of invasive RAD51 nucleofilaments in yeast, human BRCA2 performs this function, while human RAD52 regulates single strand annealing (SSA) (reviewed by Ciccia and Elledge 2010).",NA,

The resection is performed in a two-step process, where the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP) bound to BRCA1 initiate the resection. This step is regulated by the complex of CDK2 and CCNA (cyclin A), ensuring the initiation of HRR during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are available. The initial resection is also regulated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation of RBBP8 and CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 (Chen et al. 2008, Yun and Hiom 2009, Buis et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2013, Davies et al. 2015, Parameswaran et al. 2015).

These cargo need to be recognized and concentrated into COPII vesicles, which range in size from 60-90 nm, and which move cargo from the ER to the ERGIC in mammalian cells (reviewed in Lord et al, 2013; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Recognition of transmembrane cargo is mediated by interaction with one of the 4 isoforms of SEC24, a component of the inner COPII coat (Miller et al, 2002; Miller et al, 2003; Mossessova et al, 2003; Mancias and Goldberg, 2008). Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is concentrated into COPII vesicles through interaction with a receptor of the ERGIC-53 family, the p24 family or the ERV family. Each of these families of transmembrane receptors interact with cargo through their lumenal domains and with components of the COPII coat with their cytoplasmic domains and are packaged into the COPII vesicle along with the cargo. The receptors are subsequently?recycled to the ER in COPI vesicles through retrograde traffic (reviewed in Dancourt and Barlowe, 2010). Packaging of large cargo such as fibrillar collagen depends on the transmembrane accessory factors MIA3 (also known as TANGO1) and CTAGE5. Like the ERGIC, p24 and ERV cargo receptors, MIA3 and MIA2 (also known as CTAGE5) interact both with the collagen cargo and with components of the COPII coat. Unlike the other cargo receptors, however, MIA3 and MIA2 are not loaded into the vesicle but remain in the ER membrane (reviewed in Malhotra and Erlmann, 2011; Malhotra et al, 2015).",NA,

Deficient NER processes have been identified from the cells of cancer-prone patients with different variants of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), and Cockayne's syndrome. The XP cells exhibit an ultraviolet radiation hypersensitivity that leads to a hypermutability response to UV, offering a direct connection between deficient NER, increased mutation rate, and cancer. While the NER pathway in prokaryotes is unique, the pathway utilized in yeast and higher eukaryotes is highly conserved.NER is involved in the repair of bulky adducts in DNA, such as UV-induced photo lesions (both 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPDs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)), as well as chemical adducts formed from exposure to aflatoxin, benzopyrene and other?genotoxic agents. Specific proteins have been identified that participate in base damage recognition, cleavage of the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion, and excision of the oligonucleotide bearing the lesion. Reparative DNA synthesis and ligation restore the strand to its original state.NER consists of two related pathways called global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The pathways differ in the way in which DNA damage is initially recognized, but the majority of the participating molecules are shared between these two branches of NER. GG-NER is transcription-independent, removing lesions from non-coding DNA strands, as well as coding DNA strands that are not being actively transcribed. TC-NER repairs damage in transcribed strands of active genes.Several of the proteins involved in NER are key components of the basal transcription complex TFIIH. An ubiquitin ligase complex composed of DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 participates in both GG-NER and TC-NER, implying an important role of ubiquitination in NER regulation. The establishment of mutant mouse models for NER genes and other DNA repair-related genes has been useful in demonstrating the associations between NER defects and cancer.For past and recent reviews of nucleotide excision repair, please refer to Lindahl and Wood 1998, Friedberg et al. 2002, Christmann et al. 2003, Hanawalt and Spivak 2008, Marteijn et al. 2014).",NA,

Reducing equivalents generated from beta-oxidation of fatty acids and from the Krebs cycle enter the electron transport chain (also called the respiratory chain). During a series of redox reactions, electrons travel down the chain releasing their energy in controlled steps. These reactions drive the active transport of protons from the mitochondrial matrix , through the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The respiratory chain consists of five main types of carrier; flavins, iron-sulfur centres, quinones, cytochromes (heme proteins) and copper. The two main reducing equivalents entering the respiratory chain are NADH and FADH2. NADH is linked through the NADH-specific dehydrogenase whereas FADH2 is reoxidised within succinate dehydrogenase and a ubiquinone reductase of the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons and?with protons, is converted to form water, the end product of aerobic cellular respiration. A proton electrochemical gradient (often called protonmotive force) is established across the inner membrane, with positive charge in the intermembrane space relative to the matrix. Protons driven by the proton-motive force, can enter ATP synthase thus returning to the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthases use this exergonic flow to form ATP in the matrix, a process called chemiosmotic coupling. A by-product of this process is heat generation.An antiport, ATP-ADP translocase, preferentially exports ATP from the matrix thereby maintaining a high ADP:ATP ratio in the matrix. The tight coupling of electron flow to ATP synthesis means oxygen consumption is dependent on ADP availability (termed respiratory control). High ADP (low ATP) increases electron flow thereby increasing oxygen consumption and low ADP (high ATP) decreases electron flow and thereby decreases oxygen consumption. There are many inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Most act by either blocking the flow of electrons (eg cyanide, carbon monoxide, rotenone) or uncoupling electron flow from ATP synthesis (eg dinitrophenol). Thermogenin is a natural protein found in brown fat. Newborn babies have a large amount of brown fat and the heat generated by thermogenin is an alternative to ATP synthesis (and thus electron flow only produces heat) and allows the maintenance of body temperature in newborns.The electron transport chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and comprises some 80 proteins organized in four enzymatic complexes (I-IV). Complex V generates ATP but has no electron transfer activity. In addition to these 5 complexes, there are also two electron shuttle molecules; Coenzyme Q (also known as ubiquinone, CoQ) and Cytochrome c (Cytc). These two molecules shuttle electrons between the large complexes in the chain.How many ATPs are generated by this process? Theoretically, for each glucose molecule, 32 ATPs can be produced. As electrons drop from NADH to oxygen in the chain, the number of protons pumped out and returning through ATP synthase can produce 2.5 ATPs per electron pair. For each pair donated by FADH2, only 1.5 ATPs can be formed. Twelve pairs of electrons are removed from each glucose molecule;10 by NAD+ = 25 ATPs2 by FADH2 = 3 ATPs.Making a total of 28 ATPs. However, 2 ATPs are formed during the Krebs' cycle and 2 ATPs formed during glycolysis for each glucose molecule therefore making a total ATP yield of 32 ATPs. In reality, the energy from the respiratory chain is used for other processes (such as active transport of important ions and molecules) so under conditions of normal respiration, the actual ATP yield probably does not reach 32 ATPs.The reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, namely NADH and FADH2, are produced by the Krebs cycle (TCA cycle) and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. At three steps in the Krebs cycle (isocitrate conversion to oxoglutarate; oxoglutarate conversion to succinyl-CoA; Malate conversion to oxaloacetate), a pair of electrons (2e-) are removed and transferred to NAD+, forming NADH and H+. At a single step, a pair of electrons are removed from succinate, reducing FAD to FADH2. From the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, one step in the process forms NADH and H+ and another step forms FADH2.Cytoplasmic NADH, generated from glycolysis, has to be oxidized to reform NAD+, essential for glycolysis, otherwise glycolysis would cease to function. There is no carrier that transports NADH directly into the mitochondrial matrix and the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH so the cell uses two shuttle systems to move reducing equivalents into the mitochondrion and regenerate cytosolic NAD+. The first is the glycerol phosphate shuttle, which uses electrons from cytosolic NADH to produce FADH2 within the inner membrane. These electrons then flow to Coenzyme Q. Complex I is bypassed so only 1.5 ATPs can be formed per NADH via this route. The overall balanced equation, summing all the reactions in this system, isNADH (cytosol) + H+ (cytosol) + NAD+ (mito.) = NAD+ (cytosol) + NADH (mito.) + H+ (mito.)The malate-aspartate shuttle uses the oxidation of malate to generate NADH in the mitochondrial matrix. This NADH can then be fed directly to complex I and thus can form 3 ATPs via the respiratory chain. The overall balanced equation isNADH (cytosol) + H+ (cytosol) + FAD (inner memb.) = NAD+ (cytosol) + FADH2 (inner memb.)Both of these shuttle systems regenerate cytosolic NAD+.The entry point for NADH is complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and the entry point for FADH2 is Coenzyme Q. The input of electrons from fatty acid oxidation via ubiquinone is complicated and not shown in the diagram.",NA,

These multiprotein platforms control activation of the cysteinyl aspartate protease caspase-1 and thereby the subsequent cleavage of pro-interleukin 1B (pro-IL1B) into the active proinflammatory cytokine IL1B. Activation of caspase-1 is essential for production of IL1B and IL18, which respectively bind and activate the IL1 receptor (IL1R) and IL18 receptor (IL18R) complexes. IL1R and IL18R activate NFkappaB and other signaling cascades.As the activation of inflammasomes leads to caspase-1 activation, inflammasomes can be considered an upstream step of the IL1R and IL18R signaling cascades, linking intracellular pathogen sensing to immune response pathways mediated by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). Monocytes and macrophages do not express pro-IL1B until stimulated, typically by TLRs (Franchi et al. 2009). The resulting pro-IL1B is not converted to IL1B unless a second stimulus activates an inflammasome.?This requirement for two distinct stimuli allows tight regulation of IL1B/IL18 production, necessary because excessive IL-1B production is associated with numerous inflammatory diseases such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis (Masters et al. 2009).There are at least four subtypes of the inflammasome, characterized by the NLRP. In addition the protein AIM2 can form an inflammasome. All activate caspase-1. NLRP1 (NALP1), NLRP3 (Cryopyrin, NALP3), IPAF (CARD12, NLRC4) and AIM2 inflammasomes all have clear physiological roles in vivo. NLRP2, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP10 and NLRP12 have been demonstrated to modulate caspase-1 activity in vitro but the significance of this is unclear (Mariathasan and Monack, 2007).NLRP3 and AIM2 bind the protein 'apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD' (ASC, also called PYCARD), via a PYD-PYD domain interaction. This in turn recruits procaspase-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. NLRP1 and IPAF contain CARD domains and can bind procaspase-1 directly, though both are stimulated by ASC. Oligomerization of NLRPs is believed to bring procaspases into close proximity, leading to 'induced proximity' auto-activation (Boatright et al. 2003). This leads to formation of the active caspase tetramer. NLRPs are generally considered to be cytoplasmic proteins, but there is evidence for cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of the family member CIITA (LeibundGut-Landmann et al. 2004) and tissue/cell dependent NALP1 expression in the nucleus of neurons and lymphocytes (Kummer et al. 2007); the significance of this remains unclear.",NA,

Activation of presynaptic acetylcholine receptors leads to influx of Ca2+ and sufficient increase in local Ca2+ concentrations which could be due to either direct or indirect Ca2+ entry. Direct Ca2+ entry through acetylcholine receptors containing alpha3 beta4 receptors is sufficient for the release of noradrenaline in hippocampus. Indirect Ca2+ increase could be due to Na+ dependent depolarization and activation of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC) as in the case of dopamine release. Local Ca2+ increase could also be due to an initial Ca2+ influx through acetlycholine homomeric receptors containing alpha7 subunits and further increase in Ca2+ is elicited due to Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that involves the ryanodine receptors in the ER and the IP3 receptors.

TC-NER impairment is the underlying cause of a severe hereditary disorder Cockayne syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light.TC-NER is triggered by helix distorting lesions that block the progression of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Stalled RNA Pol II complex triggers the recruitment of ERCC6. ERCC6, commonly known as CSB (Cockayne syndrome protein B) recruits ERCC8, commonly known as CSA (Cockayne syndrome protein A). ERCC8 has 7 WD repeat motifs and is part of the ubiquitin ligase complex that also includes DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1. The ERCC8 ubiquitin ligase complex is one of the key regulators of TC-NER that probably exerts its role by ubiquitinating one or more factors involved in this repair process, including the RNA Pol II complex?and ERCC6.In addition to RNA Pol II, ERCC6 and the ERCC8 complex, the transcription elongation factor TFIIH, which is also involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), is recruited to sites of TC-NER. The TC-NER pre-incision complex also includes XPA, XAB2 complex, TCEA1 (TFIIS), HMGN1, UVSSA in complex with USP7, and EP300 (p300). XPA probably contributes to the assembly and stability of the pre-incision complex, similar to its role in GG-NER. The XAB2 complex is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and may modulate the structure of the nascent mRNA hybrid with template DNA through its RNA-DNA helicase activity, allowing proper processing of DNA damage. TCEA1 may be involved in RNA Pol II backtracking, which allows repair proteins to gain access to the damage site. It also facilitates trimming of the 3' end of protruding nascent mRNA from the stalled RNA Pol II, enabling recovery of RNA synthesis after repair.Deubiquitinating activity of the UVSSA:USP7 complex is needed for ERCC6 stability at repair sites. Non-histone nucleosomal binding protein HMGN1 and histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300) remodel the chromatin around the damaged site, thus facilitating repair.Dual incision of the lesion-containing oligonucleotide from the affected DNA strand is performed by two DNA endonucleases, the ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) complex and ERCC5 (XPG), which also participate in GG-NER. DNA polymerases delta, epsilon or kappa fill in the single stranded gap after dual incision and the remaining single strand nick is sealed by DNA ligases LIG1 or LIG3 (the latter in complex with XRCC1), similar to GG-NER. After the repair of DNA damage is complete, RNA Pol II resumes RNA synthesis.For past and recent reviews, see Mellon et al. 1987, Svejstrup 2002, Hanawalt and Spivak 2008, Vermeulen and Fousteri 2013 and Marteijn et al. 2014.",NA,

Patients with FA have been categorized into at least 15 complementation groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, -O and -P). These complementation groups correspond to the genes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4. Eight of these proteins, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, together with FAAP24, FAAP100, FAAP20, APITD1 and STRA13, form a nuclear complex termed the FA core complex. The FA core complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and is activated by DNA damage in the form of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), triggering monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which initiates repair of ICL-DNA.FANCD2 and FANCI form a complex and are mutually?dependent on one another for their respective monoubiquitination. After DNA damage and during S phase, FANCD2 localizes to discrete nuclear foci that colocalize with proteins involved in homologous recombination repair, such as BRCA1 and RAD51. The FA pathway is regulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation of FANCD2 and FANCI. ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCI and FANCD2 promotes monoubiquitination of FANCD2, stimulating the FA pathway (Cohn and D'Andrea 2008, Wang 2007). The complex of USP1 and WDR48 (UAF1) is responsible for deubiquitination of FANCD2 and negatively regulates the FA pathway (Cohn et al. 2007). Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 recruits DNA nucleases, including SLX4 (FANCP) and FAN1, which unhook the ICL from one of the two covalently linked DNA strands. The DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translesion DNA synthesis using the DNA strand with unhooked ICL as a template, thereby bypassing the unhooked ICL. The unhooked ICL is subsequently removed from the DNA via nucleotide excision repair (NER). Incision of the stalled replication fork during the unhooking step generates a double strand break (DSB). The DSB is repaired via homologous recombination repair (HRR) and involves the FA genes BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN) and BRIP1 (FANCJ) (reviewed by Deans and West 2011, Kottemann and Smogorzewska 2013). Homozygous mutations in BRCA2, PALB2 or BRIP1 result in Fanconi anemia, while heterozygous mutations in these genes predispose carriers to primarily breast and ovarian cancer. Well established functions of BRCA2, PALB2 and BRIP1 in DNA repair are BRCA1 dependent, but it is not yet clear whether there are additional roles for these proteins in the Fanconi anemia pathway that do not rely on BRCA1 (Evans and Longo 2014, Jiang and Greenberg 2015). Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancer with high penetrance. Complete loss of BRCA1 function is embryonic lethal. It has only recently been reported that a partial germline loss of BRCA1 function via mutations that diminish protein binding ability of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 result in a FA-like syndrome. BRCA1 has therefore been designated as the FANCS gene (Jiang and Greenberg 2015).The FA pathway is involved in repairing DNA ICLs that arise by exposure to endogenous mutagens produced as by-products of normal cellular metabolism, such as aldehyde containing compounds. Disruption of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH2 in FANCD2 deficient mice leads to severe developmental defects, early lethality and predisposition to leukemia. In addition to this, the double knockout mice are exceptionally sensitive to ethanol consumption, as ethanol metabolism results in accumulated levels of aldehydes (Langevin et al. 2011).",NA,

(Distinct processes of transcription and processing also occur in mitochondria.) The initial transcripts, pre-tRNAs, contain extra nucleotides at the 5' end and 3' end. 6.3% (32 of 509) of human tRNAs also contain introns, which are located in the anticodon loop, 3' to the anticodon. The additional nucleotides are removed and a non-templated CCA sequence is added to the resulting 3' terminus by processing reactions in the nucleus and cytosol (reviewed in Nakanishi and Nureki 2005, Phizicky and Hopper 2010).The order of processing and nucleotide modification events may be different for different tRNAs and its analysis is complicated by a retrograde transport mechanism that can import tRNAs from the cytosol back to the nucleus (retrograde movement, Shaheen and Hopper 2005, reviewed in Phizicky 2005). Generally, the 5' leader of the pre-tRNA is removed first by endonucleolytic cleavage by the RNase P ribonucleoprotein?complex, which contains a catalytic RNA (RNA H1 in humans) and at least 10 protein subunits (reviewed in Jarrous 2002, Xiao et al. 2002, Jarrous and Gopalan 2010).The 3' trailer is then removed by RNase Z activity, a single protein in humans (reviewed in Maraia and Lamichhane 2011). ELAC2 is a RNase Z found in both nucleus and mitochondria. ELAC1 is found in the cytosol and may also act as an RNase Z. Human tRNA genes do not encode the universal acceptor 3' terminus CCA, instead it is added post-transcriptionally by TRNT1, an unusual polymerase that requires no nucleic acid template (reviewed in Xiong and Steitz 2006, Hou 2010, Tomita and Yamashita 2014).In humans introns are spliced from intron-containing tRNAs in the nucleus by a two step mechanism that is distinct from mRNA splicing (reviewed in Popow et al. 2012, Lopes et al. 2015). The TSEN complex first cleaves 5' and 3' to the intron, generating a 2'3' cyclic phosphate on the 5' exon and a 5' hydroxyl group on the 3' exon. These two ends are ligated by a complex containing at least 6 proteins in a single reaction that both hydrolyzes the 2' phosphate bond and joins the 3' phosphate to the 5' hydroxyl. (In yeast the ligation and the hydrolysis of the 2' phosphate are separate reactions. The splicing reactions in yeast occur in the cytosol at the mitochondrial outer membrane.) Mature transfer RNAs contain a large number of modified nucleotide residues that are produced by post-transcriptional modification reactions (reviewed in Li and Mason 2014). Depending on the specific tRNA these reactions may occur before or after splicing and before or after export from the nucleus to the cytosol.",NA,

Mitochondrial RNase P, which is completely distinct from nuclear RNase P in having different protein subunits and no RNA component, cleaves at the 5' ends of tRNAs. RNase Z, an isoform of ELAC2 in mitochondria, cleaves at the 3' ends of tRNAs. (A different isoform of ELAC2 serves as RNase Z in the nucleus.) Unknown nucleases make additional cleavages near the 5' end of MT-CO3, the 5' end of CO1, the 5' end of CYB, and the 3' end of ND6.

Most BRAF mutations fall in the activation loop region of the kinase or the adjacent glycine rich region. These mutations promote increased kinase activity either by mimicking the effects of activation loop phosphorylations or by promoting the active conformation of the enzyme (Davies et al, 2002; Wan et al, 2004). Roughly 90% of BRAF mutants are represented by the single missense mutation BRAF V600E (Davies et al, 2002; Wan et al, 2004). Other highly active kinase mutants of BRAF include BRAF G469A and BRAF T599dup. G469 is in the glycine rich region of the kinase domain which plays a role in orienting ATP for catalysis, while T599 is one of the two conserved regulatory phosphorylation sites of the activation loop. Each of these mutants?has highly enhanced basal kinase activities, phosphorylates MEK and ERK in vitro and in vivo and is transforming when expressed in vivo (Davies et al, 2002; Wan et al, 2004; Eisenhardt et al, 2011). Further functional characterization shows that these highly active mutants are largely resistant to disruption of the BRAF dimer interface, suggesting that they are able to act as monomers (Roring et al, 2012; Brummer et al, 2006; Freeman et al, 2013; Garnett et al, 2005). Activating BRAF mutations occur for the most part independently of RAS activating mutations, and RAS activity levels are generally low in BRAF mutant cells. Moreover, the kinase activity of these mutants is only slightly elevated by coexpression of G12V KRAS, and biological activity of the highly active BRAF mutants is independent of RAS binding (Brummer et al, 2006; Wan et al, 2004; Davies et al, 2002; Garnett et al, 2005). Although BRAF V600E is inhibited by RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, resistance frequently develops, in some cases mediated by the expression of a splice variant that lacks the RAS binding domain and shows elevated dimerization compared to the full length V600E mutant (Poulikakos et al, 2011; reviewed in Lito et al, 2013).",NA,

The reasons for the lower prevalence of HRAS and NRAS mutations in human cancers are not fully understood, but may reflect gene-specific functions as well as differential codon usage and spatio-temporal regulation (reviewed in Prior et al, 2012; Stephen et al, 2014; Pylayeva-Gupta et al, 2011). Activating RAS mutations contribute to cellular proliferation, transformation and survival by activating the MAPK signaling pathway, the AKT pathway and the RAL GDS pathway, among others (reviewed in Stephen et al, 2014; Pylayeva-Gupta et al, 2011).Although the frequency and distribution varies between RAS genes and cancer types, the vast majority of activating RAS?mutations occur at one of three residues - G12, G13 and Q61.

Several different kinases can phosphorylate TP53 at S15 and S20. In response to double strand DNA breaks, S15 is phosphorylated by ATM (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998), and S20 by CHEK2 (Chehab et al. 1999, Chehab et al. 2000, Hirao et al. 2000). DNA damage or other types of genotoxic stress, such as stalled replication forks, can trigger ATR-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 at S15 (Lakin et al. 1999, Tibbetts et al. 1999) and CHEK1-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 at S20 (Shieh et al. 2000). In response to various types of cell stress, NUAK1 (Hou et al. 2011), CDK5 (Zhang et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2008), AMPK (Jones et al. 2005) and TP53RK (Abe et al. 2001, Facchin et al. 2003) can phosphorylate TP53 at S15, while PLK3 (Xie, Wang?et al. 2001, Xie, Wu et al. 2001) can phosphorylate TP53 at S20.Phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 promotes transcription of TP53-regulated apoptotic genes rather than cell cycle arrest genes. Several kinases can phosphorylate S46 of TP53, including ATM-activated DYRK2, which, like TP53, is targeted for degradation by MDM2 (Taira et al. 2007, Taira et al. 2010). TP53 is also phosphorylated at S46 by HIPK2 in the presence of the TP53 transcriptional target TP53INP1 (D'Orazi et al. 2002, Hofmann et al. 2002, Tomasini et al. 2003). CDK5, in addition to phosphorylating TP53 at S15, also phosphorylates it at S33 and S46, which promotes neuronal cell death (Lee et al. 2007).MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) phosphorylates TP53 at serine residue S37, promoting cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence in response to oncogenic RAS signaling (Sun et al. 2007).NUAK1 phosphorylates TP53 at S15 and S392, and phosphorylation at S392 may contribute to TP53-mediated transcriptional activation of cell cycle arrest genes (Hou et al. 2011). S392 of TP53 is also phosphorylated by the complex of casein kinase II (CK2) bound to the FACT complex, enhancing transcriptional activity of TP53 in response to UV irradiation (Keller et al. 2001, Keller and Lu 2002).The activity of TP53 is inhibited by phosphorylation at serine residue S315, which enhances MDM2 binding and degradation of TP53. S315 of TP53 is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase A (AURKA) (Katayama et al. 2004) and CDK2 (Luciani et al. 2000). Interaction with MDM2 and the consequent TP53 degradation is also increased by phosphorylation of TP53 threonine residue T55 by the transcription initiation factor complex TFIID (Li et al. 2004).Aurora kinase B (AURKB) has been shown to phosphorylate TP53 at serine residue S269 and threonine residue T284, which is possibly facilitated by the binding of the NIR co-repressor. AURKB-mediated phosphorylation was reported to inhibit TP53 transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (Wu et al. 2011).

The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which is a transcriptional target of TP53, plays the main role in TP53 protein down-regulation (Wu et al. 1993). MDM2 forms homodimers and homo-oligomers, but also functions as a heterodimer/hetero-oligomer with MDM4 (MDMX) (Sharp et al. 1999, Cheng et al. 2011, Huang et al. 2011, Pant et al. 2011). The heterodimers of MDM2 and MDM4 may be especially important for downregulation of TP53 during embryonic development (Pant et al. 2011).The nuclear localization of MDM2 is positively regulated by AKT- or SGK1- mediated phosphorylation (Mayo and Donner 2001, Zhou et al. 2001, Amato et al. 2009, Lyo et al. 2010). Phosphorylation of MDM2 by CDK1 or CDK2 decreases affinity of MDM2 for TP53 (Zhang and Prives 2001). ATM and CHEK2 kinases, activated by double strand DNA breaks, phosphorylate TP53, reducing its affinity for MDM2 (Banin et al.?1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998, Chehab et al. 1999, Chehab et al. 2000). At the same time, ATM phosphorylates MDM2, preventing MDM2 dimerization (Cheng et al. 2009, Cheng et al. 2011). Both ATM and CHEK2 phosphorylate MDM4, triggering MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of MDM4 (Chen et al. 2005, Pereg et al. 2005). Cyclin G1 (CCNG1), transcriptionally induced by TP53, targets the PP2A phosphatase complex to MDM2, resulting in dephosphorylation of MDM2 at specific sites, which can have either a positive or a negative impact on MDM2 function (Okamoto et al. 2002).In contrast to MDM2, E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF34 (CARP1) and RFFL (CARP2) can ubiquitinate phosphorylated TP53 (Yang et al. 2007).In addition to ubiquitinating MDM4 (Pereg et al. 2005), MDM2 can also undergo auto-ubiquitination (Fang et al. 2000). MDM2 and MDM4 can be deubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protease USP2 (Stevenson et al. 2007, Allende-Vega et al. 2010). The ubiquitin protease USP7 can deubiquitinate TP53, but in the presence of DAXX deubiquitinates MDM2 (Li et al. 2002, Sheng et al. 2006, Tang et al. 2006).The tumor suppressor p14-ARF, expressed from the CDKN2A gene in response to oncogenic or oxidative stress, forms a tripartite complex with MDM2 and TP53, sequesters MDM2 from TP53, and thus prevents TP53 degradation (Zhang et al. 1998, Parisi et al. 2002, Voncken et al. 2005).For review of this topic, please refer to Kruse and Gu 2009.",NA,

BRD7 binds TP53 and promotes acetylation of TP53 lysine residue K382 by acetyltransferase EP300 (p300). Acetylation of K382 enhances TP53 binding to target promoters, including CDKN1A (p21), MDM2, SERPINE1, TIGAR, TNFRSF10C and NDRG1 (Bensaad et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010. Drost et al. 2010). The histone acetyltransferase KAT6A, in the presence of PML, also acetylates TP53 at K382, and, in addition, acetylates K120 of TP53. KAT6A-mediated acetylation increases transcriptional activation of CDKN1A by TP53 (Rokudai et al. 2013). Acetylation of K382 can be reversed by the action of the NuRD complex, containing the TP53-binding MTA2 subunit, resulting in inhibition of TP53 transcriptional activity (Luo et al. 2000). Acetylation of lysine K120 in the DNA binding domain of TP53 by the MYST family acetyltransferases KAT8 (hMOF) and KAT5 (TIP60) can modulate the decision between cell cycle?arrest and apoptosis (Sykes et al. 2006, Tang et al. 2006). Studies with acetylation-defective knock-in mutant mice indicate that lysine acetylation in the p53 DNA binding domain acts in part by uncoupling transactivation and transrepression of gene targets, while retaining ability to modulate energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influencing ferroptosis (Li et al. 2012, Jiang et al. 2015).",NA,

SETD9 (SET9) methylates TP53 at lysine residue K372, resulting in increased stability and activity of TP53 (Chuikov et al. 2004, Couture et al. 2006, Bai et al. 2011).TP53 transcriptional activity is repressed by SMYD2-mediated methylation of TP53 at lysine residue K370 (Huang et al. 2006). Dimethylation of TP53 at lysine residue K373 by the complex of methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2 also represses TP53-mediated transcription (Huang et al. 2010). The chromatin compaction factor L3MBTL1 binds TP53 monomethylated at lysine?K382 by SETD8 (SET8) and, probably through changing local chromatin architecture, represses transcription of TP53 targets (West et al. 2010). The histone lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 interacts with TP53 and represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Huang et al. 2007).

The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 functions as a homodimer/homo-oligomer or a heterodimer/hetero-oligomer with MDM4 (MDMX) (Linares et al. 2003, Toledo and Wahl 2007, Cheng et al. 2011, Wade et al. 2013).Activating phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residues S15 and S20 in response to genotoxic stress disrupts TP53 interaction with MDM2. In contrast to MDM2, E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF34 (CARP1) and RFFL (CARP2) can ubiquitinate phosphorylated TP53 (Yang et al. 2007). Binding of MDM2 to TP53 is also inhibited by the tumor suppressor p14-ARF, transcribed from the CDKN2A gene in response to oncogenic signaling or oxidative stress (Zhang et al. 1998, Parisi et al. 2002, Voncken et al. 2005). Ubiquitin-dependant degradation?of TP53 can also be promoted by PIRH2 (Leng et al. 2003) and COP1 (Dornan et al. 2004) ubiquitin ligases. HAUSP (USP7) can deubiquitinate TP53, contributing to TP53 stabilization (Li et al. 2002).While post-translational regulation plays a prominent role, TP53 activity is also controlled at the level of promoter function (reviewed in Saldana-Meyer and Recillas-Targa 2011), mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Mahmoudi et al. 2009, Le et al. 2009, Takagi et al. 2005).",NA,

Substrates of GGCX include blood clotting factors, osteocalcin (OCN), and growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) (Brenner et al. 1998). Vitamin K is derived from green leafy vegetables as phylloquinone and is synthesized by gut flora as menaquinone-7. These molecules are taken up by intestinal enterocytes with other lipids, packaged into chylomicrons, and delivered via the lymphatic and blood circulation to tissues of the body, notably hepatocytes and osteoblasts, via processes of lipoprotein trafficking (Shearer & Newman 2014; Shearer et al. 2012) described elsewhere in Reactome.In these tissues, menadiol (reduced vitamin K3) reacts with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to form MK4 (vitamin K hydroquinone), the form of the vitamin required as cofactor for gamma-carboxylation of protein glutamate residues (Hirota?et al. 2013). The gamma-carboxylation reactions, annotated elsewhere in Reactome as a part of protein metabolism, convert MK4 to its epoxide form, which is inactive as a cofactor. Two related enzymes, VKORC1 and VKORCL1, can each catalyze the reduction of MK4 epoxide to active MK4. VKORC1 activity is essential for normal operation of the blood clotting cascade and for osteocalcin function (Ferron et al. 2015). A physiological function for VKORCL1 has not yet been definitively established (Hammed et al. 2013; Tie et al. 2014)",NA,

Similar to other related RTKs, such as EGFR, ligand binding induces MET dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation, resulting in the active MET receptor complex (Ferracini et al. 1991, Longati et al. 1994, Rodrigues and Park 1994, Kirchhofer et al. 2004, Stamos et al. 2004, Hays and Watowich 2004). Phosphorylated tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of MET serve as docking sites for binding of adapter proteins, such as GRB2, SHC1 and GAB1, which trigger signal transduction cascades that activate PI3K/AKT, RAS, STAT3, PTK2, RAC1 and RAP1 signaling (Ponzetto et al. 1994, Pelicci et al. 1995, Weidner et al. 1995, Besser et al. 1997, Shen and Novak 1997, Beviglia and Kramer 1999, Rodrigues et al. 2000, Sakkab et al. 2000, Schaeper et al. 2000, Lamorte et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2002, Chen and?Chen 2006, Palamidessi et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2011, Murray et al. 2014).Activation of PLC gamma 1 (PLCG1) signaling by MET remains unclear. It has been reported that PLCG1 can bind to MET directly (Ponzetto et al. 1994) or be recruited by phosphorylated GAB1 (Gual et al. 2000). Tyrosine residue Y307 of GAB1 that serves as docking sites for PLCG1 may be phosphorylated either by activated MET (Watanabe et al. 2006) or SRC (Chan et al. 2010). Another PCLG1 docking site on GAB1, tyrosine residue Y373, was reported as the SRC target, while the kinase for the main PLCG1 docking site, Y407 of GAB1, is not known (Chan et al. 2010).Signaling by MET promotes cell growth, cell survival and motility, which are essential for embryonic development (Weidner et al. 1993, Schmidt et al. 1995, Uehara et al. 1995, Bladt et al. 1995, Maina et al. 1997, Maina et al. 2001, Helmbacher et al. 2003) and tissue regeneration (Huh et al. 2004, Borowiak et al. 2004, Liu 2004, Chmielowiec et al. 2007). MET signaling is frequently aberrantly activated in cancer, through MET overexpression or activating MET mutations (Schmidt et al. 1997, Pennacchietti et al. 2003, Smolen et al. 2006, Bertotti et al. 2009).Considerable progress has recently been made in the development of HGF-MET inhibitors in cancer therapy. These include inhibitors of HGF activators, HGF inhibitors and MET antagonists, which are protein therapeutics that act outside the cell. Kinase inhibitors function inside the cell and have constituted the largest effort towards MET-based therapeutics (Gherardi et al. 2012).Pathogenic bacteria of the species Listeria monocytogenes, exploit MET receptor as an entryway to host cells (Shen et al. 2000, Veiga and Cossart 2005, Neimann et al. 2007).For review of MET signaling, please refer to Birchmeier et al. 2003, Trusolino et al. 2010, Gherardi et al. 2012, Petrini 2015.",NA,

The biologically active HGF is the heterodimer of alpha and beta chains that are produced via proteolytic cleavage of pro-HGF by the plasma membrane bound serine protease Hepsin (HPN) (Kirchhofer et al. 2005, Owen et al. 2010) or the ECM-associated serine protease Hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFAC, commonly known as HGFA) (Shia et al. 2005). HGF binds to the extracellular SEMA and PSI domains of MET RTK, inducing a conformational change that enables MET dimerization or oligomerization (Kirchhofer et al. 2004, Stamos et al. 2004, Hays and Watowich 2004, Gherardi et al. 2006). MET dimers trans-autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues in the activation loop, leading to increased kinase activity, and on tyrosine residues at the cytoplasmic tail that serve as docking sites for adapter proteins involved in MET?signal transduction (Ferracini et al. 1991, Longati et al. 1994, Rodrigues and Park 1994, Ponzetto et al. 1994).CD44v6 was implicated as a MET co-receptor, but its role has been disputed (Orian-Rousseau et al. 2002, Dortet et al. 2010, Olaku et al. 2011, Hasenauer et al. 2013, Elliot et al. 2014).",NA,

Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRJ dephosphorylates MET tyrosine residue Y1349, thus removing the docking site for the GAB1 adapter (Palka et al. 2003). Protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN1 and PTPN2 dephosphorylate MET tyrosines Y1234 and Y1235 in the kinase activation loop, thus attenuating catalytic activity of MET (Sangwan et al. 2008). The E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL promotes ubiquitination of the activated MET receptor and subsequent MET degradation. CBL contains a RING finger domain that engages E2 protein ubiquitin ligases to mediate ubiquitination of MET, which may occur at the cell membrane or in the early endocytic compartment. Ubiquitinated MET is degraded in a late endosomal or lysosomal compartment in a proteasome-dependent manner. The involvement of proteasome in MET degradation seems to be indirect, through an effect on MET endocytic trafficking (Jeffers et?al. 1997, Peschard et al. 2001, Hammond et al. 2001, Petrelli et al. 2002). LRIG1 promotes lysosome-dependent degradation of MET in the absence of HGF-mediated activation (Lee et al. 2014, Oh et al. 2014).MET-mediated activation of RAS signaling is inhibited by MET receptor binding to MUC20 (Higuchi et al. 2004) or RANBP10 (Wang et al. 2004).",NA,

Epigenetic repression involves the recruitment of Mi-2/NuRD upon SALL4 binding to the PTEN promoter (Yang et al. 2008, Lu et al. 2009) or EVI1-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC) to the PTEN promoter (Song et al. 2009, Yoshimi et al. 2011). Transcriptional regulation is also elicited by negative regulators, including NR2E1:ATN1 (atrophin-1) complex, JUN (c-Jun), SNAIL and SLUG (Zhang et al. 2006, Vasudevan et al. 2007, Escriva et al. 2008, Uygur et al. 2015) and positive regulators such as TP53 (p53), MAF1, ATF2, EGR1 or PPARG (Stambolic et al. 2001, Virolle et al. 2001, Patel et al. 2001, Shen et al. 2006, Li et al. 2016).MicroRNAs miR-26A1, miR-26A2, miR-22, miR-25, miR-302, miR-214, miR-17-5p, miR-19 and miR-205 bind PTEN mRNA and inhibit its translation into protein. These microRNAs are alteredÂ in cancer and can account for changes in PTEN levels (Meng et al. 2007, Xiao et al. 2008, Yang et al. 2008, Huse et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2010, Poliseno, Salmena, Riccardi et al. 2010, Cai et al. 2013). In addition, coding and non-coding RNAs can prevent microRNAs from binding to PTEN mRNA. These RNAs are termed competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs. Transcripts of the pseudogene PTENP1 and mRNAs transcribed from SERINC1, VAPA and CNOT6L genes exhibit this activity (Poliseno, Salmena, Zhang et al. 2010, Tay et al. 2011, Tay et al. 2014).PTEN can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after undergoing monoubiquitination. PTEN's ability to localize to the nucleus contributes to its tumor suppressive role (Trotman et al. 2007). The ubiquitin protease USP7 (HAUSP) targets monoubiquitinated PTEN in the nucleus, resulting in PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear exclusion. PML, via an unknown mechanism that involves USP7- and PML-interacting protein DAXX, inhibits USP7-mediated deubiquitination of PTEN, thus promoting PTEN nuclear localization. Disruption of PML function in acute promyelocytic leukemia, through a chromosomal translocation that results in expression of a fusion protein PML-RARA, leads to aberrant PTEN localization (Song et al. 2008).Several ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4, WWP2, STUB1 (CHIP), RNF146, XIAP and MKRN1, polyubiquitinate PTEN and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Wang et al. 2007, Van Themsche et al. 2009, Ahmed et al. 2011, Maddika et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2015, Li et al. 2015). The ubiquitin proteases USP13 and OTUD3, frequently down-regulated in breast cancer, remove polyubiquitin chains from PTEN, thus preventing its degradation and increasing its half-life (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015). The catalytic activity of PTEN is negatively regulated by PREX2 binding (Fine et al. 2009, Hodakoski et al. 2014) and TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination (Lee et al. 2013), most likely through altered PTEN conformation.In addition to ubiquitination, PTEN also undergoes SUMOylation (Gonzalez-Santamaria et al. 2012, Da Silva Ferrada et al. 2013, Lang et al. 2015, Leslie et al. 2016). SUMOylation of the C2 domain of PTEN may regulate PTEN association with the plasma membrane (Shenoy et al. 2012) as well as nuclear localization of PTEN (Bassi et al. 2013, Collaud et al. 2016). PIASx-alpha, a splicing isorom of E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2 has been implicated in PTEN SUMOylation (Wang et al. 2014). SUMOylation of PTEN may be regulated by activated AKT (Lin et al. 2016). Reactions describing PTEN SUMOylation will be annotated when mechanistic details become available.Phosphorylation affects the stability and activity of PTEN. FRK tyrosine kinase (RAK) phosphorylates PTEN on tyrosine residue Y336, which increases PTEN half-life by inhibiting NEDD4-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN. FRK-mediated phosphorylation also increases PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009). Casein kinase II (CK2) constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of PTEN on serine and threonine residues S370, S380, T382, T383 and S385. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases PTEN protein stability (Torres and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (Miller et al. 2002).PTEN localization and activity are affected by acetylation of its lysine residues (Okumura et al. 2006, Ikenoue et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2016). PTEN can undergo oxidation, which affects its function, but the mechanism is poorly understood (Tan et al. 2015, Shen et al. 2015, Verrastro et al. 2016).",NA,

Whereas U6 snRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, U1,U2, U4, U4atac, U5, U11, and U12 genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Transcription of the U1 and U2 genes has been most extensively studied and the other snRNA genes as well as other genes with similar promoter structures, for example the SNORD13 gene, are inferred to be transcribed by similar reactions. The snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are distinguished from mRNA-encoding genes by the presence of a proximal sequence element (PSE) rather than a TATA box and the presence of the Integrator complex rather than the Mediator complex (reviewed in Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008).The snRNA genes?are among the most rapidly transcribed genes in the genome. The 5' transcribed region of the U2 snRNA gene is largely single-stranded during interphase and metaphase (Pavelitz et al. 2008) and chromatin within the transcribed region is cleared of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014). Transcriptional activation of the RNA polymerase II transcribed snRNA genes begins with binding of transcription factors to the distal sequence element (DSE) of the promoter (reviewed in Hernandez 2001, Egloff et al. 2008, Jawdeker and Henry 2008). The factors, which include POU2F1 (Oct-1), POU2F2 (Oct-2), ZNF143 (Staf) and Sp1, promote binding of the SNAPc complex (also known as PTF and PBP) to the PSE. SNAPc helps clear the gene of nucleosomes (O'Reilly et al. 2014) and recruits initiation factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and snTAFc:TBP) which recruit RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008) by CDK7 recruits RPAP2 and the Integrator complex, which is required for later processing of the 3' end of the pre-snRNA transcript (reviewed in Chen and Wagner 2010, Baillat and Wagner 2015). The Little Elongation Complex (LEC) also appears to bind around the time of transcription initiation (Hu et al. 2013). As transcription proceeds, RPAP2 dephosphorylates serine-5 and P-TEFb phosphorylates serine-2 of the CTD. As transcription reaches the end of the snRNA gene serine-7 of the CTD is phosphorylated. These marks serve to bind protein complexes and are required for 3' processing of the pre-snRNA (reviewed in Egloff and Murphy 2008). After transcription proceeds through the conserved 3' processing sequence of the pre-snRNA the Integrator complex cleaves the pre-snRNA. Transcription then terminates downstream in a less well characterized reaction that requires elements of the polyadenylation system.",NA,

This involves the crosslinking of keratinocyte proteins such as loricrin and involucrin by transglutaminases and the breakdown of the nucleus and other organelles by intracellular and secreted proteases (Eckhart et al. 2000, Denecker et al. 2008). This process is strictly regulated by the Ca2+ concentration gradient in the epidermis (Esholtz et al. 2014). Loricrin and involucrin are encoded in ¡®Epidermal Differentiation Complex¡¯ linked to a large number of genes encoding nonredundant components of the CE (Kypriotou et al. 2012, Niehues et al. 2016). Keratinocytes produce specialized proteins and lipids which are used to construct the cornified envelope (CE), a heavily crosslinked submembranous layer that confers rigidity to the upper epidermis, allows keratin filaments to attach to any location in the cell membrane (Kirfel et al. 2003) and acts as?a water-impermeable barrier. The CE has two functional parts: covalently cross-linked proteins (10 nm thick) that comprise the backbone of the envelope and covalently linked lipids (5 nm thick) that coat the exterior (Eckert et al. 2005). Desmosomal components are crosslinked to the CE to form corneodesmosomes, which bind cornified cells together (Ishida-Yamamoto et al. 2011). Mature terminally differentiated cornified cells consist mostly of keratin filaments covalently attached to the CE embedded in lipid lamellae (Kalinin et al. 2002). The exact composition of the cornified envelope varies between epithelia (Steinert et al. 1998); the relative amino-acid composition of the proteins used may determine differential mechanical properties (Kartasova et al. 1996).",NA,

This activity is countered by lysophospholipid acyltransferases, and the balance of these may influence whether transport tubules or transport vesicles form (de Figuiredo et al, 1998; reviewed in Bechler et al, 2012). RAB6-dependent tubules also depend on the dynein-dynactin motor complex and the hoomodimeric Bicaudal proteins (Matanis et al, 2002; Yamada et al, 2013; reviewed in Heffernan?and Simpson, 2014).",NA,

The structure and function of the Golgi are tightly interconnected, such that proteins that are required for protein transport through the Golgi are often also required for the organization of the Golgi stacks, and vice versa (reviewed in Liu and Storrie, 2012; Liu and Storrie, 2015; Chia and Gleeson, 2014; Munro, 2011). Newly synthesized proteins from the ER and ERGIC are received at the cis face of the Golgi and flow through to the trans-Golgi before being released to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for further secretion to the endolysosomal system, plasma membrane or extracellular region. Retrograde flow from the trans- to cis-cisternae moves endocytosed cargo from the extracellular region, the plasma membrane and the endolysosomal system back towards the ER. Intra-Golgi retrograde traffic also returns resident Golgi proteins to?their appropriate cisternae, in this way facilitating cisternal remodeling or maturation (reviewed in Boncompain and Perez, 2013; Day et al, 2013). Intra-Golgi traffic in both directions is mediated by COPI carriers, with specificity of transport being determined at least in part by the complement of SNAREs, RABs and tethering proteins involved",NA,

Typical cargo includes recycling resident TGN proteins such as TGOLN2 (also known as TGN46), receptors such as the mannose-6-phosphate receptors and toxins like Shiga, cholera and ricin which use the retrograde trafficking machinery to 'hitchhike' back through the secretory system for release into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Johannes and Popoff, 2008; Pfeffer, 2011; Sandvig et al, 2013). These cargo are trafficked from the endocytic system in a clathrin- and AP1-dependent manner that is described in more detail in the ""Trans-Golgi network budding pathway"" (just not yet). In general, it appears that vesicles are uncoated prior to their tethering and fusion at the TGN. At the TGN, at least 2 distinct tethering pathways exist. A RAB6-dependent pathway contributes to the fusion and docking of vesicles from the early endocytic pathway. These vesicles, which carry cargo such?as TGOLN2 and toxins, dock at the TGN through interactions with TGN-localized Golgin tethers and with the multisubunit tethering complexes COG and GARP (reviewed in Bonafacino and Rojas, 2006; Bonafacino and Hierro, 2011; Pfeffer, 2011). In contrast, mannose-6-phosphate receptors appear to traffic from late endosomes to the TGN through a RAB9- and PLIN3-dependent pathway. Vesicles are recruited to the TGN through interaction of RAB9 with the atypical RHO GTPase RHOBTB3, and tethered by virtue of interaction with TGN-localized Golgins and the GARP complex (Perez-Victoria et al, 2008; Perez-Victoria et al, 2009; Diaz et al, 1999; reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011; Chia and Gleeson, 2014)",NA,

Anterograde cargo from the ERGIC and ER is received at the cis-Golgi, trafficked through the medial- and trans-Golgi and released through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endolysosomal system and the plasma membrane. Although still under debate, current models of Golgi trafficking favour the cisternal maturation model, where anterograde cargo remain associated with their original lipid membrane during transit through the Golgi and are exposed to sequential waves of processing enzymes by the retrograde movement of Golgi resident proteins. In this way, cis-cisterna mature to medial- and trans-cisterna as the early acting Golgi enzymes are replaced by later acting ones (reviewed in Pelham, 2001; Storrie, 2005; Glick and Nakano, 2009; Szul and Sztul, 2011). More recently.?a kiss-and-run (KAR) model for intra-Golgi trafficking has been proposed, which marries aspects of the cisternal maturation model with a diffusion model of transport (reviewed in Mironov et al, 2103).Like the anterograde ERGIC-to Golgi transport step, intra-Golgi trafficking between the cisterna appears to be COPI-dependent (Storrie and Nilsson, 2002; Szul and Sztul, 2011). Numerous snares and tethering complexes contribute to the targeting and fusion events that are required to maintain the specificity and directionality of these trafficking events (reviewed in Chia and Gleeson, 2014). Golgi tethers include long coiled coiled proteins like the Golgins, as well as multisubunit tethers like the COG complex. These tethers make numerous interactions with other components of the secretory system including RABs, SNAREs, motor and coat proteins as well as components of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Munro, 2011; Willet et al, 2013). Retrograde traffic from the cis-Golgi back to the ERGIC and ER depends on both the COPI-dependent pathway, which appears to be important for recyling of KDEL receptors, and a more recently described COPI-independent pathway that relies on RAB6 (reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011; Heffernan and Simpson, 2014).

PI5P is used as a substrate for production of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PI(4,5)P2 (Rameh et al. 1997, Clarke et al. 2008, Clarke et al. 2010, Clarke and Irvine 2013, Clarke et al. 2015), which serves as a substrate for activated PI3K, resulting in the production of PIP3 (Mandelker et al. 2009, Burke et al. 2011).

PIP3 is necessary for the activating phosphorylation of AKT. AKT1 can be deactivated by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex that contains a regulatory subunit B56-beta (PPP2R5B) or B56-gamma (PPP2R5C). PI5P inhibits AKT1 dephosphorylation by PP2A through an unknown mechanism (Ramel et al. 2009). Increased PI5P levels correlate with inhibitory?phosphorylation(s) of the PP2A complex. MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1) are involved in inhibitory phosphorylation of PP2A, in a process that involves IER3 (IEX-1) (Letourneux et al. 2006, Rocher et al. 2007).

PDCL enables completion of G-protein beta folding by TRiC/CCT, promotes release of folded G-protein beta subunits 1-4 (GNB1, GNB2, GNB3, GNB4) from the chaperonin complex, and facilitates the formation of the heterodimeric G-protein beta:gamma complex between G-protein beta subunits 1-4 and G-protein gamma subunits 1-12 (Lukov et al. 2005, Lukov et al. 2006, Howlett et al. 2009, Lai et al. 2013, Plimpton et al. 2015, Xie et al. 2015).

DNA replication is carried out during a discrete temporal period known as the S (synthesis)-phase, and chromosome segregation occurs during a massive reorganization of cellular architecture at mitosis. Two gap-phases separate these cell cycle events: G1 between mitosis and S-phase, and G2 between S-phase and mitosis. Cells can exit the cell cycle for a period and enter a quiescent state known as G0, or terminally differentiate into cells that will not divide again, but undergo morphological development to carry out the wide variety of specialized functions of individual tissues.A family of protein serine/threonine kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) controls progression through the cell cycle. As the name suggests, the kinase activity of the catalytic subunits is dependent on binding to cyclin partners, and control of cyclin abundance is one?of several mechanisms by which CDK activity is regulated throughout the cell cycle. A complex network of regulatory processes determines whether a quiescent cell (in G0 or early G1) will leave this state and initiate the processes to replicate its chromosomal DNA and divide. This regulation, during the Mitotic G1-G1/S phases of the cell cycle, centers on transcriptional regulation by the DREAM complex, with major roles for D and E type cyclin proteins.Chromosomal DNA synthesis occurs in the S phase, or the synthesis phase, of the cell cycle. The cell duplicates its hereditary material, and two copies of each chromosome are formed. A key aspect of the regulation of DNA replication is the assembly and modification of a pre-replication complex assembled on ORC proteins.Mitotic G2-G2/M phases encompass the interval between the completion of DNA synthesis and the beginning of mitosis. During G2, the cytoplasmic content of the cell increases. At G2/M transition, duplicated centrosomes mature and separate and CDK1:cyclin B complexes become active, setting the stage for spindle assembly and chromosome condensation at the start of mitotic M phase. Mitosis, or M phase, results in the generation of two daughter cells each with a complete diploid set of chromosomes. Events of the M/G1 transition, progression out of mitosis and division of the cell into two daughters (cytokinesis) are regulated by the Anaphase Promoting Complex.The Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C) plays additional roles in regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, insuring the appropriate length of the G1 phase.

As the CDKs functioning at different points in the cell cycle are regulated by different means, the various checkpoints differ in the biochemical mechanisms by which they elicit their effect. However, all checkpoints share a common hierarchy of a sensor, signal transducers, and effectors that interact with the CDKs.The stability of the genome in somatic cells contrasts to the almost universal genomic instability of tumor cells.

During G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin A is synthesized and associates with Cdk2. After forming in the cytoplasm, the Cyclin A:Cdk2 complexes are translocated to the nucleus (Jackman et al.,2002). Prior to S phase entry, the activity of Cyclin A:Cdk2 complexes is negatively regulated through Tyr 15 phosphorylation of Cdk2 (Gu et al., 1995) and also by the association of the cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs), p27 and p21. Phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for the activation of the CDK2 kinase activity (Aprelikova et al., 1995). The entry into S phase is promoted by the removal of inhibitory Tyr 15 phosphates from the Cdk2 subunit of Cyclin A:Cdk2 complex by the Cdc25 phosphatases (Blomberg and Hoffmann, 1999) and by SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation of p27/p21 (see Ganoth et al., 2001). While Cdk2 is thought to play a primary role in regulating entry into S phase, recent evidence indicates that Cdk1 is equally capable of promoting entry into S phase and the initiation of DNA replication (see Bashir and Pagano, 2005).

Gluconeogenesis is confined to cells of the liver and kidney and enables glucose synthesis from molecules such as lactate and alanine and other amino acids when exogenous glucose is not available (reviewed, e.g., by Gerich 1993). The process of gluconeogenesis as diagrammed below occurs in two parts: a network of reactions converts mitochondrial pyruvate to cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate; then phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a single sequence of cytosolic reactions.Three variants of the first part of the process are physiologically important. 1) A series of transport and transamination reactions convert mitochondrial oxaloacetate to cytosolic oxaloacetate which is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by a hormonally regulated, cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This variant allows?regulated glucose synthesis from lactate. 2) Mitochondrial oxaloacetate is reduced to malate, which is exported to the cytosol and re-oxidized to oxaloacetate. This variant provides reducing equivalents to the cytosol, needed for glucose synthesis from amino acids such as alanine and glutamine. 3) Constitutively expressed mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyzes the conversion of mitochondrial oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate which is then transported to the cytosol. The exact path followed by any one molecule of pyruvate through this reaction network is determined by the tissue in which the reactions are occurring, the source of the pyruvate, and the physiological stress that triggered gluconeogenesis.In all cases, the synthesis of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate requires the generation and consumption of two reducing equivalents as cytosolic NADH + H+. For pyruvate derived from lactate (variants 1 and 3), NADH + H+ is generated with the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate in the cytosol (a reaction of pyruvate metabolism not shown in the diagram). For pyruvate derived from amino acids (variant 2), mitochondrial NADH + H+ generated by glutamate dehydrogenase (a reaction of amino acid metabolism, not shown) is used to reduce oxaloacetate to malate, which is transported to the cytosol and re-oxidized, generating cytosolic NADH + H+. The synthesis of glucose from pyruvate also requires the consumption of six high-energy phosphates, four from ATP and two from GTP.In the second part of gluconeogenesis, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate, however derived, is converted to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by reactions that are the reverse of steps of glycolysis.

It also plays a central role in balancing the energy needs of various tissues in the body. Under conditions in which oxygen supply is limiting, e.g., in exercising muscle, or in the absence of mitochondria, e.g., in red blood cells, re-oxidation of NADH produced by glycolysis cannot be coupled to generation of ATP.

Although the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis are distinct, they involve three common intermediates, glucose 6-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate, so the two pathways are interconnected. The pentose phosphate pathway consists of eight reactions:1. Conversion glucose 6-phosphate to D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 2. Conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; 3. Conversion of 6-phospho-D-gluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 4. Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate; 5. Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate; 6. Rearrangement of ribose 5-phosphate and xylulose 5-phosphate to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and?glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 7. Rearrangement of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate; and 8. Rearrangement of xylulose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, reactions 1-3, generates NADPH and pentose 5-phosphate. The non-oxidative branch of the pathway, reactions 4-8, converts pentose 5-phosphate to other sugars.The overall pathway can operate to generate only NADPH (glucose 6-phosphate is converted to pentose 5-phosphates, which are directed to the synthesis of fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which in turn are converted back to glucose 6-phosphate). The reactions of the non-oxidative branch can operate to generate net amounts of ribose 5-phosphate with no production of NADPH. Net flux through this network of reactions appears to depend on the metabolic state of the cell and the nature of the biosynthetic reactions underway (Casazza and Veech 1987).G6PD, the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of the pathway, is more extensively mutated in human populations than any other enzyme, pehaps because these mutant alleles confer malaria resistance (Luzzatto and Afolayan 1968).

Finally, acetate in the mitochondrion can be condensed with coenzyme A to form acetyl CoA. Polymorphisms in the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps are associated with variation in the efficiency of alcohol catabolism in human populations (Chen et al. 1999; Lange et al. 1976; Jornvall 1985).

The cap is also important for mRNA stability, protecting it from 5' to 3' nucleases, and is required for mRNA export to the cytoplasm.The capping reaction usually occurs very rapidly on nascent transcripts; after the synthesis of only a few nucleotides by RNA polymerase II. The capping reaction involves the conversion of the 5'-end of the nascent transcript from a triphosphate to a diphosphate by a RNA 5'-triphosphatase, followed by the addition of a guanosine monophosphate by the mRNA guanylyltransferase, to form a 5'-5'-triphosphate linkage.

The two partial reactions are coupled so that reaction intermediates are usually undetectable.

In the liver, C to U editing is important in the expression of specific isoforms of the apolipoprotein B enzyme. ApoB mRNA editing is a posttranscriptional, nuclear process that can be initiated after splicing, at the time of polyadenylation and is completed by the time pre-mRNA matures fully (reviewed by Blanc and Davidson, 2003).This editing event is a simple hydrolytic cytidine deamination to uridine, and is carried out by the Apobec-1 enzyme, along with the Apobec-1 complementing factor, ACF. The editing of apo-B mRNA involves the site-specific deamination of (C6666 to U), which converts codon 2153 from a glutamine codon, CAA, to a premature stop codon, UAA. As ACF is distributed in a variety of tissues, and these genes contain multiple family members, it is possible?that editing events in additional targets will be found.The cis-acting regulatory elements for C to U editing include: 22 nt editing site within ApoB mRNA, 5' tripartite motif with an enhancer element adjacent to the target cytidine, a spacer element and mooring sequence both 3' to the cytidine (reviewed by Smith et al., 1997).",NA,

Thus the time that it takes for pol II to synthesize each intron defines a minimal time and distance along the gene in which splicing factors can be recruited. The time that it takes for pol II to reach the end of the gene defines the maximal time in which splicing could occur co-transcriptionally. Thus, the kinetics of transcription can affect the kinetics of splicing.Any covalent change in a primary (nascent) mRNA transcript is mRNA Processing.

Therefore, this mechanism is often called cap-dependent translation initiation. Proximity to the cap, as well as the nucleotides surrounding an AUG codon, influence the efficiency of the start site recognition during the scanning process. However, if the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will ignore and skip potential starting AUGs, a phenomenon called leaky scanning. Leaky scanning allows a single mRNA to encode several proteins that differ in their amino-termini. Merrick (2010) provides an overview of this process and hghlights several features of it that remain incompletely understood.Several eukaryotic cell and viral mRNAs initiate translation by an alternative mechanism that involves internal initiation rather than ribosomal scanning. These mRNAs contain?complex nucleotide sequences, called internal ribosomal entry sites, where ribosomes bind in a cap-independent manner and start translation at the closest downstream AUG codon. Initiation on several viral and cellular mRNAs is cap-independent and is mediated by binding of the ribosome to internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. These elements are often found in characteristically long structured regions on the 5'-UTR of an mRNA that may or may not have regulatory upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Both of these features on the 5'-end of the mRNA hinder ribosomal scanning, and thus promote a cap-independent translation initiation mechanism. IRESs act as specific translational enhancers that allow translation initiation to occur in response to specific stimuli and under the control of different trans-acting factors, as for example when cap-dependent protein synthesis is shut off during viral infection. Such regulatory elements have been identified in the mRNAs of growth factors, protooncogenes, angiogenesis factors, and apoptosis regulators, which are translated under a variety of stress conditions, including hypoxia, serum deprivation, irradiation and apoptosis. Thus, cap-independent translational control might have evolved to regulate cellular responses in acute but transient stress conditions that would otherwise lead to cell death, while the same mechanism is of major importance for viral mRNAs to bypass the shutting-off of host protein synthesis after infection. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus exemplify two distinct mechanisms of IRES-mediated initiation. In contrast to cap-dependent initiation, the eIF4A and eIF4G subunits of eIF4F bind immediately upstream of the EMCV initiation codon and promote binding of a 43S complex. Accordingly, EMCV initiation does not involve scanning and does not require eIF1, eIF1A, and the eIF4E subunit of eIF4F. Nonetheless, initiation on some EMCV-like IRESs requires additional non-canonical initiation factors, which alter IRES conformation and promote binding of eIF4A/eIF4G. Initiation on the hepatitis C virus IRES is simpler: a 43S complex containing only eIF2 and eIF3 binds directly to the initiation codon as a result of specific interaction of the IRES and the 40S subunit.",NA,

This process can be divided into three distinct stages: initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the two subunits of the ribosome are brought together to the translation start site on the mRNA where the polypeptide chain is to begin. Extension of the polypeptide chain occurs when a specific aminoacyl-tRNA, as determined by the template mRNA, binds an elongating ribosome. The protein chain is released from the ribosome when any one of three stop codons in the relevant reading frame on the mRNA is reached. Individual reactions at each one of these stages are catalyzed by a number of initiation, elongation and release factors, respectively.Proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contain a short sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues (approximately 20 residues) at their N-termini. Upon protrusion of the signal sequence from the translating?ribosome, the signal sequence is bound by the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP), translation is temporarily halted, and the SRP:nascent peptide:ribosome complex then docks with a SRP receptor complex on the ER membrane. There the nascent peptide:ribosome complex is transferred from the SRP complex to a translocon complex embedded in the ER membrane and reoriented so that the nascent polypeptide protrudes through a pore in the translocon into the ER lumen. Translation now resumes, the signal peptide is cleaved from the polypeptide by signal peptidase as the signal peptide emerges into the ER, and elongation proceeds with the growing polypeptide oriented into the ER lumen.The 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome are translated within the mitochondrion by mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) at the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial translation reflects both the bacterial origin of the organelle and subsequent divergent evolution during symbiosis. Mitoribosomes have shorter rRNAs, mitochondria-specific proteins, and rearranged protein positions. Mitochondrial mRNAs have either no untranslated leaders or very short untranslated leaders of 1-3 nucleotides. Translation begins with N-formylmethionine, as in bacteria, and continues with cycles of aminoacyl-tRNA:TUFM:GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of TUFM:GDP. All 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome are hydrophobic inner membrane proteins which are inserted cotranslationally into the membrane by an interaction with OXA1L. Translation is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP recognizes a UAA or UAG codon at the A-site of the mitoribosome. The translated polypeptide is released and MRRF and GFM2:GTP act to dissociate the 55S ribosome into 28S and 39S subunits",NA,

PRPP and the enzymatic activity responsible for its synthesis were first described by Kornberg et al. (1955). The enzyme, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, has been purified from human erythrocytes and characterized biochemically. The purified enzyme readily forms multimers; its smallest active form appears to be a dimer and for simplicity it is annotated as a dimer here. It specifically catalyzes the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP or dATP to D-ribose 5-phosphate, and has an absolute requirement for Mg++ and orthophosphate (Fox and Kelley 1971; Roth et al. 1974). The significance of the reaction with dATP in vivo is unclear, as the concentration of cytosolic dATP is normally much lower than that of ATP. The importance of this enzyme for purine synthesis in vivo has been established by demonstrating excess phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate?synthetase activity, correlated with elevated enzyme levels or altered enzyme properties, in individuals whose rates of uric acid production are constitutively abnormally high (Becker and Kim 1987; Roessler et al. 1993).Molecular cloning studies have revealed the existence of two additional genes that encode phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase-like proteins, one widely expressed (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2) and one whose expression appears to be confined to the testis (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1-like 1) (Taira et al. 1989; 1991). Neither of these proteins has been purified and characterized enzymatically, nor have variations in the abundance or sequence of either protein been associated with alterations in human nucleotide metabolism (Roessler et al. 1993; Becker et al. 1996), so their dimerization and ability to catalyze the synthesis of PRPP from D-ribose 5-phosphate are inferred here on the basis of their predicted amino acid sequence similarity to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1.",NA,

Transcription initiation include promoter DNA binding, DNA melting, and initial synthesis of short RNA transcripts. The transition from initiation to elongation, is referred to as promoter escape and leads to a stable elongation complex that is characterized by an open DNA region or transcription bubble.

In human cells the rDNA gene clusters are localized on the short arm of the five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes. The rRNA promoter has two essential and specially spaced sequences: a CORE element and an upstream control element (UCE, also called UPE). The CORE element of the human promoter overlaps with the transcription start site, extending from 20 to 45, and is required for specific initiation of transcription. The polymerase is a multisubunit complex, composed of two large subunits (the most conserved portions include the catalytic site that shares similarity with other eukaryotic and bacterial multisubunit RNA polymerases) and a number of smaller subunits. Under a number of experimental conditions the core is competent to mediate ribonucleic acid synthesis, in vivo however, it requires additional factors to select the appropriate template.

Except for the APEX1-independent resolution of AP sites via single nucleotide base excision repair mediated by NEIL1 or NEIL2 (Wiederhold et al. 2004, Das et al. 2006), single nucleotide and multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathways are both initiated by APEX1-mediated displacement of DNA glycosylases and cleavage of the damaged DNA strand by APEX1 immediately 5' to the AP site (Wilson et al. 1995, Bennett et al. 1997, Masuda et al. 1998). The BER proceeds via the single nucleotide replacement when the AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) deoxyribose residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created single strand break (SSB) (5'dRP) can be removed by the 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB) (Bennett et al. 1997). POLB fills the created single nucleotide gap by adding a nucleotide complementary?to the undamaged DNA strand to the 3' end of the SSB. The SSB is subsequently ligated by DNA ligase III (LIG3) which, in complex with XRCC1, is recruited to the BER site by an XRCC1-mediated interaction with POLB (Kubota et al. 1996). BER proceeds via the multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathway when the AP residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created SSB undergoes oxidation-related damage (5'ddRP) and cannot be cleaved by POLB (Klungland and Lindahl 1997). Long-patch BER can be completed by POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001). When the PCNA-containing replication complex is available, as is the case with cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA strand displacement synthesis is catalyzed by DNA polymerase delta (POLD) or DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) complexes, in the presence of PCNA, RPA, RFC, APEX1, FEN1 and LIG1 (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Dianova et al. 2001).

These genotoxic chemicals generate major lesions like 1-methyladenine, 3-methyladenine, 3-methylcytosine and O6-methylguanine in DNA. Cells have built in repair mechanisms against such toxic molecules. For example, 3-methyladeninie-DNA glycosylases excise some methylated bases while MGMT/hAGT protein transfers alkyl groups from others lesions onto cysteine residues. E.coli AlkB protein has a unique function wherein 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine are demethylated by a combination of oxidative decarboxylation and hydroxylation activities. AlkB and its human orthologs, ALKBH2 (ABH2) and ALKBH3 (ABH3) belong to alpha-ketoglutarate deoxygenase family of enzymes that oxidize chemically inert compounds in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate, oxygen and ferrous ions. As a byproduct of these chemical reactions, formaldehyde is released in the case of methylated lesions and acetaldehyde?in the case 1-ethyladenine in DNA. CO2 and succinate are also released in an intermediate step not shown in the following illustration. Unlike other mechanisms which involve some kind of nuclease activities, this type of repair mechanism leaves the repaired bases intact by just removing the reactive alkyl groups that get bound to the bases thereby effecting accurate restoration of damaged DNA sequences (Trewick et al. 2002, Duncan et al. 2002, Sedgwick 2004).",NA,

About 10% of the total transcription in dividing cells can be attributed to its activity. It synthesizes an eclectic collection of catalytic or structural RNA molecules, some of which are involved in protein synthesis, pre-mRNA splicing, tRNA processing, and the control of RNA polymerase II elongation, whereas some others have still unknown functions. Like other RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase III cannot recognize its target promoters directly. Instead it is recruited to specific promoter sequences through the help of transcription factors. There are three basic types of RNA polymerase III promoters, called types 1, 2, and 3(Geiduschek and Kassavetis, 1992). Although in vivo, RNA polymerase III may be recruited to these promoters as part of a large complex (holo RNA polymerase III) containing the polymerase and its initiation factors (Wang et al., 1997), in vitro the reaction can be divided?into several steps. First, the promoter elements are recognized by DNA binding factors, which then recruit a factor known as TFIIIB. TFIIIB itself then directly contacts RNA polymerase III. In human cells but not in S. cerevisiae, there are at least two versions of TFIIIB. One contains TBP, Bdp1, and Brf1 (Brf1-TFIIIB), and the other TBP, Bdp1, and Brf2 (Brf2-TFIIIB) (Schramm et al., 2000; Teichmann et al., 2000).",NA,

The first two are synthesized from acetyl-CoA, in the mitochondria of liver cells; acetone is formed by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Ketone body synthesis in liver is effectively irreversible because the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA is not present in liver cells.Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids and triglycerides, are water-soluble. They are exported from the liver, and are taken up by other tissues, notably brain and skeletal and cardiac muscle. There, they are broken down to acetyl-CoA which is oxidized via the TCA cycle to yield energy. In a normal person, this pathway of ketone body synthesis and utilization is most active during extended periods of fasting. Under these conditions, mobilization and breakdown of stored fatty acids generates abundant acetyl-CoA acetyl-CoA in liver cells for synthesis of ketone bodies, and their utilization in?other tissues minimizes the demand of these tissues for glucose (Sass 2011).",NA,

It is particularly prevalent in the brain, where it leads to amino acid changes that affect the conductance of several ion channels. Inosines are recognized by the translation machinery as if they were guanosines.ADARs (Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA) modify pre-mRNA, acting as single peptides and recognize structural determinants in the RNA. To date 3 members of this deaminase family are known: ADAR 1, ADAR 2, and ADAR 3 that share a common modular domain structure. ADAR 1 and 2 contain a catalytic deaminase domain, a double-stranded RNA binding domain and exhibit RNA editing activity. ADAR1 activity is found in various mammalian tissues with the highest concentration in brain.An increasing number of mammalian genes have been found to undergo deamination by ADARs. Deamination by editing in pre-mRNAs encoding subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) is another well studied example. An?editing event at the Q/R site of the GluR2 (GluRB) subunit of AMPA receptors converts a Gln codon CAG to an Arg codon CIG rendering the heteromeric receptor impermeable to Ca 2+ ions. Another example is the editing of 5-HT2C subtype serotonin receptor mRNA resulting in receptor isoforms with reduced G-protein coupling efficiency (reviewed by Gerber and Keller, 2001).In mice, the editosomes with ADAR proteins require some cis-acting elements like an intronic 'editing-site complementary sequence (ECS)'.

Saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs can be synthesized by elongation od palmitic acid synthesized de novo or derived from the diet. Polyunsaturated VLCFAs are synthesized from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids - humans lack the desaturase enzymes to synthesize these molecules from stearate.Chemically, the elongation process that yields VLCFA parallels the one by which palmitate (16 carbones) or stearate (18 carbons) are synthesized de novo from acetate. The starting fatty acid is activated by conjugation with coenzyme A (CoA-SH), condensed with malonyl-CoA to form a 3-oxoacyl CoA containing two more carbon atoms than the starting long chain fatty acyl CoA and CO2, reduced with NADPH to a 3-hydroxyacyl?CoA, dehydrated to a trans 2,3-enoyl-CoA, and reduced with NADPH to yield a fatty acyl-CoA two carbons longer than the starting one.The process differs from the de novo one in that the enzymatic activities resposible for each step are expressed by different proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, not by separate domains of a single multifunctional cytosolic protein. In humans, activation is catalyzed by one of five acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain (ACSL) enzymes, conjugation by one of seven elongation of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) proteins, reduction by one of two HSB17B estradiol dehydrogenases, dehydration by one of four protein tyrosine phosphatase-like / 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (PTPL / HACD) proteins, and reduction by one of two trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase (TECR) proteins.

Homo sapiens,R-HSA-75893,TNF signaling,Signal Transduction,Reactome,"Version 81, 2022",4,"HMDB0001341, HMDB0000538","The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is expressed in immune and nonimmune cell types including macrophages, T cells, mast cells, granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, fibroblasts, neurons, keratinocytes and smooth muscle cells as a response to tissue injury or upon immune responses to pathogenic stimuli (K?ck A. et al. 1990; Dubravec DB et al. 1990; Walsh LJ et al. 1991; te Velde AA et al. 1990; Imaizumi T et al. 2000). TNF-alpha interacts with two receptors, namely TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Activation of TNFR1 can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways inducing inflammation, proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-alpha-stimulated cell will survive or die is dependent on autocrine/paracrine signals, and on the cellular context.TNF binding to TNFR1 results initially in the formation of complex I that consists of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated?death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC2,BIRC3 (cIAP1/2,cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) and LUBAC (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of ubiquitin chains by BIRC2/3 and LUBAC (composed of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN ) to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and activation of the TAK1 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)) complex and I¦ÊB kinase (IKK) complex. TAK1 and IKK phosphorylate RIPK1 to limit its cytotoxic activity and activate both nuclear factor kappa©\light©\chain©\enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB) and mitogen©\activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways promoting cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BIRC, cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1¦Â-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6). When the survival pathway is inhibited, the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 detaches from the membrane-bound TNFR1 signaling complex and recruits Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase-8 (also known as complex II). Once recruited to FADD, multiple procaspase-8 molecules interact via their tandem death-effector domains( DED), thereby facilitating both proximity-induced dimerization and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8, which are required for initiation of apoptotic cell death (Hughes MA et al. 2009; Oberst A et al. 2010). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions (e.g. caspase-8 inhibitory proteins such as CrmA and vICA after infection with cowpox virus or CMV) or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is physically and functionally engaged by its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Tewari M & Dixit VM 1995; Fliss PM & Brune W 2012; Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al., 2009). Within the complex II procaspase-8 can also form heterodimers with cFLIP isoforms, FLIP long (L) and FLIP short (S), which are encoded by the NFkappaB target gene CFLAR (Irmler M et al. 1997; Boatright KM et al. 2004; Yu JW et al. 2009; Pop C et al. 2011). FLIP(S) appears to act purely as an antagonist of caspase-8 activity blocking apoptotic but promoting necroptotic cell death (Feoktistova et al. 2011). The regulatory function of FLIP(L) has been found to differ depending on its expression levels. FLIP(L) was shown to inhibit death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis only when expressed at high levels, while low cell levels of FLIP(L) enhanced DR signaling to apoptosis (Boatright KM et al. 2004; Okano H et al. 2003; Yerbes R et al. 2011; Yu JW et al. 2009; Hughes MA et al. 2016). In addition, caspase-8:FLIP(L) heterodimer activity within the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1:FADD:CASP8:FLIP(L) complex allowed cleavage of RIPK1 to cause the dissociation of the TRADD:TRAF2:RIP1:FADD:CASP8, thereby inhibiting RIPK1-mediated necroptosis (Feoktistova et al. 2011, 2012). TNF-alpha can also activate sphingomyelinase (SMASE, such as SMPD2,3) proteins to catalyze hydrolysis of sphingomyeline into ceramide (Adam D et al.1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1998; S¨¦gui B et al. 2001). Activation of neutral SMPD2,3 leads to an accumulation of ceramide at the cell surface and has proinflammatory effects. However, TNF can also activate the pro-apoptotic acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-A-SMase form (Edelmann B et al. 2011). Ceramide induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses. Further, ceramide can be converted by ceramidase into sphingosine, which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P exerts the opposite biological effects to ceramide by activating cytoprotective signaling to promote cell growth counteracting the apoptotic stimuli (Cuvillier O et al. 1996). Thus, TNF-alpha-induced TNFR1 activation leads to divergent intracellular signaling networks with extensive cross-talk between the pro-apoptotic/necroptotic pathway, and the other NFkappaB, and MAPK pathways providing highly specific cell responses initiated by various types of stimuli.",NA,

The genes active during elongation fall under different classes like, housekeeping, cell-cycle regulated, development and differentiation specific genes etc. The list of genes involved in elongation has been growing in recent times, and include: -TFIIS,DSIF, NELF, P-Tefb etc. that are involved in drug induced or sequence-dependent arrest - TFIIF, ELL, elongin, elongator etc. that are involved in increasing the catalytic rate of elongation by altering the Km and/or the Vmax of Pol II?-FACT, Paf1 and other factors that are involved chromatin modification - DNA repair proteins, RNA processing and export factors, the 19S proteasome and a host of other factors like Spt5-Spt5, Paf1, and NELF complexes, FCP1P etc. (Arndt and Kane, 2003). Elongation also represents processive phase of transcription in which the activities of several mRNA processing factors are coupled to transcription through their binding to RNA polymerase (Pol II). One of the key events that enables this interaction is the differential phosphorylation of Pol II CTD. Phosphorylation pattern of CTD changes during transcription, most significantly at the beginning and during elongation process. TFIIH-dependent Ser5 phosphorylation is observed primarily at promoter regions while P-Tefb mediated Ser2 phosphorylation is seen mainly in the coding regions, during elongation. Experimental evidence suggests a dynamic association of RNA processing factors with differently modified forms of the polymerase during the transcription cycle. (Komarnitsky et al., 2000).

IP3 opens Ca2+ channels in the platelet dense tubular system, raising intracellular Ca2+ levels. DAG is a second messenger that regulates a family of Ser/Thr kinases consisting of PKC isozymes (Nishizuka 1995). DAG achieves activation of PKC isozymes by increasing their affinity for phospholipid.

If these results reflect ENT2 function in vivo, they indicate that the net movement of a nucleoside or base across the cell membrane is determined not only by its own concentrations in the extracellular space and the cytosol, but also by the concentrations of the other nucleosides and bases competing for access to the transporter.The human genome encodes three concentrative transporters, SLC28A1, 2, and 3 (solute carrier family 28 (sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter), member 1, 2, and 3). All three genes have been cloned, and expression of the human proteins in Xenopus oocytes has allowed their transport properties to be determined. SLC28A1 mediates the uptake of pyrimidine nucleosides and adenosine (Ritzel et al. 1997); SLC28A2 the uptake of purine nucleosides and uridine (Wang et al. 1997); and SLC28A3 the uptake of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (Ritzel et al. 2001). Amino acid sequence motifs that determine the specificities of these transporters have been identified in studies of chimeric and mutant proteins (Loewen et al. 1999). SLC28A3 protein co-transports two sodium ions per nucleoside; SLC28A1 and 2 transport one sodium per nucleoside (Ritzel et al. 2001).Physiological roles for nucleoside and base transport include provision of nucleosides to cells with little capacity to synthesize these molecules de novo, and regulation of extracellular levels of adenosine, which is released from muscle during intense exercise and has signaling properties. In kidney and intestinal epithelia, the combination of apically localized CNT transporters and basolaterally localized ENT transporters provides a mechanism for net transport of nucleosides (Mangravite et al. 2003). These transporters also mediate the uptake of nucleoside analogs used clinically as anti-viral and anti-tumor drugs.Orthologs of human concentrative and equilibrative transporter proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes, but functional studies of transporters even from organisms closely related to humans (e.g. rat, Gerstin et al. 2002) have revealed differences in substrate specificities. Prediction of drug uptake and other functions of these molecules by human - model organism orthology is thus risky.",NA,

It consists of NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD) and procaspase-1; CARD8 (Cardinal) is also suggested to be a component. It is activated by a number of pathogens and bacterial toxins as well as diverse PAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) such as hyaluronan and uric acid, and exogenous irritants such as silica and asbestos (see Table S1 Schroder & Tschopp, 2010). Mutations in NLRP3 which lead to constitutive activation are linked to the human diseases Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and NOMID (Ting et al. 2006), characterized by skin rashes and other symptoms associated with generalized inflammation. The cause of these symptoms is uncontrolled IL-1 beta production. Multiple studies have shown that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by particulate activators (e.g. Hornung et al. 2008) requires phagocytosis, but this is not required for the response to ATP, which is mediated by the P2X7 receptor (Kahlenberg & Dubyak, 2004) and appears to involve the pannexin membrane channel (Pellegrin & Suprenenant 2006).

INFG exerts its effect on cells by interacting with the specific IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR). IFNGR consists of two chains, namely IFNGR1 (also known as the IFNGR alpha chain) and IFNGR2 (also known as the IFNGR beta chain). IFNGR1 is the ligand binding receptor and is required but not sufficient for signal transduction, whereas IFNGR2 do not bind IFNG independently but mainly plays a role in IFNG signaling and is generally the limiting factor in IFNG responsiveness. Both IFNGR chains lack intrinsic kinase/phosphatase activity and thus rely on other signaling proteins like Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) for signal transduction. IFNGR complex in its resting state is a preformed tetramer and upon IFNG association undergoes a conformational change.

It is considered to be a Pattern Recognition Receptor (Liliensiek et al. 2004). It recognizes a large variety of modified proteins known as advanced glycation/glycosylation endproducts (AGEs), a heterogenous group of structures that are generated by the Maillard reaction, a consequence of long-term incubation of proteins with glucose (Ikeda et al. 1996). Their accumulation is associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, renal failure and ageing (Schmidt et al. 1999). The most prevalent class of AGE in vivo are N(6)-carboxymethyllysine (NECML) adducts (Kislinger et al. 1991). In addition to AGEs, AGER is a signal transduction receptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Ab) (Yan et al. 1996), mediating Ab neurotoxicity and promoting Ab influx into the brain. AGER also responds to the proinflammatory S100/calgranulins (Hofmann et al. 1999) and High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1/Amphoterin/DEF), a protein linked to neurite outgrowth and cellular motility (Hori et al. 1995).The major inflammatory pathway stimulated by AGER activation is NFkappaB. Though the signaling cascade is unclear, several pieces of experimental data suggest that activation of AGER leads to sustained activation and upregulation of NFkappaB, measured as NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus, and increased levels of de novo synthesized NFkappaB (Bierhaus et al. 2001). As this is clearly an indirect effect it is represented here as positive regulation of NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus. AGER can bind ERK1/2 and thereby activate the MAPK and JNK cascades (Bierhaus et al. 2005).",NA,

Since ERBB2 forms heterodimers with EGFR and since MET can heterodimerize with both ERBB2 and EGFR (Tanizaki et al. 2011), it is not clear if MET and EGFR activate PTK6 directly or act through ERBB2. Levels of PTK6 increase under hypoxic conditions (Regan Anderson et al. 2013, Pires et al. 2014). The kinase activity of PTK6 is negatively regulated by PTPN1 phosphatase (Fan et al. 2013) and SRMS kinase (Fan et al. 2015), as well as the STAT3 target SOCS3 (Gao et al. 2012).PTK6 activates STAT3-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2009, Ikeda et al. 2010) and may also activate STAT5-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2011). PTK6 promotes cell motility and migration by regulating the activity of RHO GTPases RAC1 (Chen et al. 2004) and RHOA (Shen et al.?2008), and possibly by affecting motility-related kinesins (Lukong and Richard 2008). PTK6 crosstalks with AKT1 (Zhang et al. 2005, Zheng et al. 2010) and RAS signaling cascades (Shen et al. 2008, Ono et al. 2014) and may be involved in MAPK7 (ERK5) activation (Ostrander et al. 2007, Zheng et al. 2012). PTK6 enhances EGFR signaling by inhibiting EGFR down-regulation (Kang et al. 2010, Li et al. 2012, Kang and Lee 2013). PTK6 may also enhance signaling by IGF1R (Fan et al. 2013) and ERBB3 (Kamalati et al. 2000).PTK6 promotes cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating CDK inhibitor CDKN1B (p27) (Patel et al. 2015).PTK6 activity is upregulated in osteopontin (OPN or SPP1)-mediated signaling, leading to increased VEGF expression via PTK6/NF-kappaB/ATF4 signaling path. PTK6 may therefore play a role in VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis (Chakraborty et al. 2008).PTK6 binds and phosphorylates several nuclear RNA-binding proteins, including SAM68 family members (KHDRSB1, KHDRSB2 and KHDRSB3) (Derry et al. 2000, Haegebarth et al. 2004, Lukong et al. 2005) and SFPQ (PSF) (Lukong et al. 2009).

Ubiquitination of target proteins usually occurs between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of the target, although linkages with cysteine, serine, and threonine residues are also observed (reviewed in Wang et al. 2012, McDowell and Philpott 2013).Ubiquitin must first be processed from larger precursors and then activated by formation of a thiol ester bond between ubiquitin and an E1 activating enzyme (UBA1 or UBA6) and transfer to an E2 conjugating enzyme before being transferred by an E3 ligase to a target protein. Precursor proteins containing multiple ubiquitin monomers (polyubiquitins) are produced from the UBB and UBC genes; precursors?containing a single ubiquitin monomer and a ribosomal protein are produced from the UBA52 and RPS27A genes. Many proteases (deubiquitinases) may potentially process these precursors yielding monomeric ubiquitin. The proteases OTULIN and USP5 are particularly active in cleaving the polyubiquitin precursors, whereas the proteases UCHL3, USP7, and USP9X cleave the ubiquitin-ribosomal protein precursors yielding ubiquitin monomers (Grou et al. 2015). A resultant ubiquitin monomer is activated by adenylation of the C-terminal glycine followed by conjugation of the C-terminus to a cysteine residue of the E1 enzymes UBA1 or UBA6 via a thiol ester bond. The ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 enzyme to a cysteine residue of one of several E2 enzymes (reviewed in van Wijk and Timmers 2010, Stewart et al. 2016). Through a less well characterized mechanism, E3 ubiquitin ligases then bring a target protein and the E2-ubiquitin conjugate into proximity so that the ubiquitin is transferred via formation of an amide bond to a particular lysine residue (or, in rarer cases, a thiol ester bond to a cysteine residue or an ester bond to a serine or threonine residue) of the target protein (reviewed in Berndsen and Wolberger 2014). Based on protein homologies, families of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified that include RING-type ligases (reviewed in Deshaies et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012, Metzger et al. 2014), HECT-type ligases (reviewed in Rotin et al. 2009, Metzger et al. 2012), and RBR-type ligases (reviewed in Dove et al. 2016). A subset of the RING-type ligases participate in CULLIN-RING ligase complexes (CRLs which include SCF complexes, reviewed in Lee and Zhou 2007, Genschik et al. 2013, Skaar et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2014).Some E3-E2 combinations catalyze mono-ubiquitination of the target protein (reviewed in Nakagawa and Nakayama 2015). Other E3-E2 combinations catalyze conjugation of further ubiquitin monomers to the initial ubiquitin, forming polyubiquitin chains. (It may also be possible for some E3-E2 combinations to preassemble polyubiquitin and transfer it as a unit to the target protein.) Ubiquitin contains several lysine (K) residues and a free alpha amino group to which further ubiquitin can be conjugated. Thus different types of polyubiquitin are possible: K11 linked polyubiquitin is observed in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), K29 linked polyubiquitin is observed in lysosomal degradation, K48 linked polyubiquitin directs target proteins to the proteasome for degradation, whereas K63 linked polyubiquitin generally acts as a scaffold to recruit other proteins in several cellular processes, notably DNA repair (reviewed in Komander et al. 2009). Ubiquitination is highly regulated (reviewed in Vittal et al. 2015) and affects all cellular processes including DNA damage response (reviewed in Brown and Jackson 2015), immune signaling (reviewed in Park et al. 2014, Lutz-Nicoladoni et al. 2015), and regulation of normal and cancerous cell growth (reviewed in Skaar and Pagano 2009, Yerlikaya and Yontem 2013, Strikoudis et al. 2014).",NA,

Human GTSE1, similar to the mouse counterpart, binds to microtubules, shows cell cycle regulated expression with a peak in G2 and plays a role in G2 checkpoint recovery after DNA damage but is not transcriptionally regulated by TP53 (Monte et al. 2003, Monte et al. 2004, Scolz et al. 2012).In G1 cells, GTSE1 is found at the microtubule lattice, likely due to direct binding to tubulin. An evolutionarily conserved interaction between GTSE1 and MAPRE1 (EB1), a microtubule plus end protein, promotes GTSE1 localization to the growing tip of the microtubules, which contributes to cell migration and is likely involved in cancer cell invasiveness. Highly invasive breast cancer cell lines exhibit high GTSE1 levels?in G1, while GTSE1 levels in G1 are normally low. At the beginning of mitotic prometaphase, GTSE1 is phosphorylated by mitotic kinase(s), possibly CDK1, in proximity to the MAPRE1-binding region, causing GTSE1 dissociation from the plus end microtubule ends (Scolz et al. 2012).During G2 checkpoint recovery (cell cycle re-entry after DNA damage induced G2 arrest), GTSE1 relocates to the nucleus where it binds TP53 and, in an MDM2-dependent manner, promotes TP53 cytoplasmic translocation and proteasome mediated degradation (Monte et al. 2003, Monte et al. 2004). Relocation of GTSE1 to the nucleus in G2 phase depends on PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of GTSE1 (Liu et al. 2010).GTSE1-facilitated down-regulation of TP53 in G2 allows cells to avoid TP53 mediated apoptosis upon DNA damage and to re-enter cell cycle (Monte et al. 2003). While TP53 down-regulation mediated by GTSE1 in G2 correlates with decreased expression of TP53 target genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, GTSE1 can also increase the half-life of the TP53 target p21 (CDKN1A). GTSE1-mediated stabilization of CDKN1A involves interaction of GTSE1 with CDKN1A and its chaperone complex, consisting of HSP90 and FKBPL (WISp39), and may be involved in resistance to paclitaxel treatment",NA,

Many growth factors and their receptor-type protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a critical role in inflammation, wound healing and tissue remodelling. The growth factor hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (MST1, also known as macrophage-stimulating protein, MSP) binds to a specific receptor, macrophage-stimulating protein receptor (MST1R, also known as RON, recepteur d'origine nantais). MST1 belongs to the kringle protein family, which includes HGF and plasminogen. It is produced by the liver and circulates in the blood as a biologically-inactive single chain precursor (pro-MST1). Proteolytic cleavage of pro-MST1 into the biologically-active MST1 dimer is necessary for receptor binding. Cleavage occurs during blood coagulation and at inflammatory sites, the resultant MST1 dimer then binds MST1R?receptors on local macrophages. MST1R is ubiquitously expressed but mainly in epithelial cells.MST1 binding to MST1R promotes receptor homodimerisation which in turn allows autophosphorylation of two tyrosine residues within the catalytic site which regulates kinase activity and allows phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal binding site of the receptor. The docking site is essential for downstream signaling through direct and indirect binding of SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins such as GRB2, PI3K, and SRC. MST1/MST1R signaling plays a dual role in regulating inflammation; initially stimulating chemotaxis and phagocytosis (macrophage activation) and then exerts broad inhibitory effects on macrophages, limiting the extent of inflammtory responses (Wang et al. 2002). MST1R is upregulated in many epithelial cancers where it is thought to play a role in the progression of these types of cancer (Kretschmann et al. 2010).",NA,

Often through their indirect interactions with coat components, motors, tethering factors and SNAREs, the Rab GTPases serve as multifaceted organizers of almost all membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. To perform these diverse processes, Rab GTPases interconvert between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. The GTP-bound activated form mediates membrane transport through specific interaction with multiple effector molecules (Zerial & McBride 2001, Stenmark 2009, Zhen & Stenmark 2015, Cherfils & Zeghouf 2013). Conversion from the GTP- to the GDP-bound form occurs through GTP hydrolysis, which is not only driven by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rab protein but is also catalysed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GAPs not only increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, but they are also involved in the inactivation of RABs, making sure they are inactivated at the correct membrane.?Human cells contain as many as 70 Rabs and at least 51 putative Rab GAPs (Pfeffer 2005). Only a few of these GAPs have been matched to a specific Rab substrate. The Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing RAB-specific GAPs (TBC/RABGAPs) are a key family of RAB regulators, where the TBC domain facilitates the inactivation of RABs by facilitating activation of GTPase activity of the RAB (Pan et al. 2006, Frasa et al. 2012, Stenmark 2009). Studies suggest that TBC/RABGAPs are more than just negative regulators of RABs and can integrate signalling between RABs and other small GTPases, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes like intracellular trafficking (Frasa et al. 2012).",NA,

CLASP proteins, which may be monomeric or tetrameric, are recruited to the plasma membrane through interaction with phosphoinsitides and recognize linear or conformational sequences or post-translational modifications in the cytoplasmic tails of the cargo protein. Through bivalent interactions with clathrin and/or other CLASP proteins, they bridge the recruitment of the cargo to the emerging clathrin coated pit (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013). The tetrameric AP-2 complex, first identified in early studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was at one time thought to be the primary CLASP protein involved in cargo recognition at the plasma membrane, and indeed plays a key role in the endocytosis of cargo carrying dileucine- or tyrosine-based motifs. A number?of studies have been performed to test whether AP-2 is essential for all forms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Keyel et al, 2006; Motely et al, 2003; Huang et al, 2004; Boucrot et al, 2010; Henne et al, 2010; Johannessen et al, 2006; Gu et al, 2013; reviewed in Traub, 2009; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011). Although depletion of AP-2 differentially affects the endocytosis of different cargo, extensive depletion of AP-2 through RNAi reduces clathrin-coated pit formation by 80-90%, and the CCPs that do form still contain AP-2, highlighting the critcical role of this complex in CME (Johannessen et al, 2006; Boucrot et al, 2010; Henne et al, 2010).In addition to AP-2, a wide range of other CLASPs including proteins of the beta-arrestin, stonin and epsin families, engage sorting motifs in other cargo and interact either with clathrin, AP-2 or each other to facilitate assembly of a clathin-coated pit (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).",NA,

CME contributes to signal transduction by regulating the cell surface expression and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Most RTKs exhibit a robust increase in internalization rate after binding specific ligands; however, some RTKs may also exhibit significant ligand-independent internalization (reviewed in Goh and Sorkin, 2013). CME controls RTK and GPCR signaling by organizing signaling both within the plasma membrane and on endosomes (reviewed in Eichel et al, 2016; Garay et al, 2015; Vieira et al, 1996; Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2014; Di Fiori and von Zastrow, 2014; Barbieri et al, 2016). CME also contributes to the uptake of material such as metabolites,?hormones and other proteins from the extracellular space, and regulates membrane composition by recycling membrane components and/or targeting them for degradation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves initiation of clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation, cargo selection, coat assembly and stabilization, membrane scission and vesicle uncoating. Although for simplicity in this pathway, the steps leading to a mature CCP are represented in a linear and temporally distinct fashion, the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a highly heterogeneous process and clear temporal boundaries between these processes may not exist (see for instance Taylor et al, 2011; Antonescu et al, 2011; reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014). Cargo selection in particular is a critical aspect of the formation of a mature and stable CCP, and many of the proteins involved in the initiation and maturation of a CCP contribute to cargo selection and are themselves stabilized upon incorporation of cargo into the nascent vesicle (reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).Although the clathrin triskelion was identified early as a major component of the coated vesicles, clathrin does not bind directly to membranes or to the endocytosed cargo. Vesicle formation instead relies on many proteins and adaptors that can bind the plasma membrane and interact with cargo molecules. Cargo selection depends on the recognition of endocytic signals in cytoplasmic tails of the cargo proteins by adaptors that interact with components of the vesicle's inner coat. The classic adaptor for clathrin-coated vesicles is the tetrameric AP-2 complex, which along with clathrin was identified early as a major component of the coat. Some cargo indeed bind directly to AP-2, but subsequent work has revealed a large family of proteins collectively known as CLASPs (clathrin- associated sorting proteins) that mediate the recruitment of diverse cargo into the emerging clathrin-coated vesicles (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013). Many of these CLASP proteins themselves interact with AP-2 and clathrin, coordinating cargo recruitment with coat formation (Schmid et al, 2006; Edeling et al, 2006; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013; Kirchhausen et al, 2014). Initiation of CCP formation is also influenced by lipid composition, regulated by clathrin-associated phosphatases and kinases (reviewed in Picas et al, 2016). The plasma membrane is enriched in PI(4,5)P2. Many of the proteins involved in initiating clathrin-coated pit formation bind to PI(4,5)P2 and induce membrane curvature through their BAR domains (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Daumke et al, 2014). Epsin also contributes to early membrane curvature through its Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which promotes membrane curvature by inserting into the lipid bilayer (Ford et al, 2002). Following initiation, some CCPs progress to formation of vesicles, while others undergo disassembly at the cell surface without producing vesicles (Ehrlich et al, 2004; Loerke et al, 2009; Loerke et al, 2011; Aguet et al, 2013; Taylor et al, 2011). The assembly and stabilization of nascent CCPs is regulated by several proteins and lipids (Mettlen et al, 2009; Antonescu et al, 2011).Maturation of the emerging clathrin-coated vesicle is accompanied by further changes in the lipid composition of the membrane and increased membrane curvature, promoted by the recruitment of N-BAR domain containing proteins (reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012; Picas et al, 2016). Some N-BAR domain containing proteins also contribute to the recruitment of the large GTPase dynamin, which is responsible for scission of the mature vesicle from the plasma membrane (Koh et al, 2007; Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003; Soulet et al, 2005; David et al, 1996; Owen et al, 1998; Shupliakov et al, 1997; Taylor et al, 2011; Ferguson et al, 2009; Aguet et al, 2013; Posor et al, 2013; Chappie et al, 2010; Shnyrova et al, 2013; reviewed in Mettlen et al, 2009; Daumke et al, 2014). After vesicle scission, the clathrin coat is dissociated from the new vesicle by the ATPase HSPA8 (also known as HSC70) and its DNAJ cofactor auxilin, priming the vesicle for fusion with a subsequent endocytic compartment and releasing clathrin for reuse (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Sousa and Laufer, 2015).",NA,

However, deregulation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012). Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al. 1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared?to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5 due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C. CDK5 phosphorylates CDC25A at S40, S116 and S261; CDC25B at S50, T69, S160, S321 and S470; and CDC25C at T48, T67, S122, T130, S168 and S214. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C not only increases their phosphatase activities but also facilitates their release from 14-3-3 inhibitory binding. CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C in turn activate CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases causing neuronal death. Consistent with this mechanism, higher CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C activities were observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical samples, as compared to age-matched controls. Inhibition of CDC25 isoforms confers neuroprotection to beta-amyloid toxicity, which underscores the contribution of this pathway to AD pathogenesis",NA,

PrP deposits in neuronal cell bodies are mainly confined to endosomes and lysosomes, which is attributed to neuronal uptake of pathological proteins and intercellular prion spreading.In Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), deposits of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) are formed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies and neurites. In multiple system atrophy (MSA), deposits of alpha-synuclein form in the cytoplasm of glial cells (Papp-Lantos bodies).Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are characterized by ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP, commonly known as TDP-43), a protein that normally localizes to the nucleus.

Conversion between the inactive and active form relies on the activities of RAB guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Yoshimura et al, 2010; Wu et al, 2011; Pan et al, 2006; Frasa et al, 2012; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).Newly synthesized RABs are bound by a RAB escort protein, CHM (also known as REP1) or CHML (REP2) (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Shen and Seabra, 1996). CHM/REP proteins are the substrate-binding component of the trimeric RAB geranylgeranyltransferase enzyme (GGTaseII) along with the two catalytic subunits RABGGTA and RABGGTB (reviewed in Gutkowska and Swiezewska, 2012; Palsuledesai and Distefano, 2015). REP proteins recruit the unmodified RAB in its GDP-bound state to the GGTase for sequential geranylgeranylation at one or two C-terminal cysteine residues (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Seabra et al 1996; Shen and Seabra, 1996; Baron and Seabra, 2008). After geranylgeranylation, CHM/REP proteins remain in complex with the geranylgeranylated RAB and escort it to its target membrane, where its activity is regulated by GAPs, GEFs, GDIs and membrane-bound GDI displacement factors (GDFs) (Sivars et al, 2003; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).",NA,

These small GTPases contribute to trafficking specificity by localizing to the membranes of different organelles and interacting with effectors such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases and tubular-vesicular cargo (reviewed in Stenmark et al, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Zhen and Stenmark, 2015). RAB localization depends on a number of factors including C-terminal prenylation, the sequence of upstream hypervariable regions and what nucleotide is bound, as well as interaction with RAB-interacting proteins (Chavrier et al, 1991; Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Farnsworth et al, 1994; Seabra, 1996; Wu et al, 2010; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014). More recently, the activity of RAB GEFs has also been implicated in regulating the localization of RAB proteins (Blumer et al, 2103; Schoebel et al, 2009; Cabrera and Ungermann,?2013; reviewed in Barr, 2013; Zhen and Stenmark, 2015)In the active, GTP-bound form, RAB proteins are membrane-associated, while in the inactive GDP-bound form, RABs are extracted from the target membrane and exist in a soluble form in complex with GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Gavriljuk et al, 2013).

While many GEFs contain one of three conserved GEF domains identified to date - the DENN (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cell) domain, the VPS9 domain and the SEC2 domain- other GEFs lack a conserved domain (reviewed in Ishida et al, 2016). Based on sequence conservation and subunit organization, GEFs can be grouped into 6 general classes: the DENND-containing GEFs, the VPS9-containing GEFs (both monomeric), the SEC2-containing GEFs (homodimeric), heterodimeric GEF complexes such as RIC1:RGP1, the multisubunit TRAPPC GEF, and others (reviewed in Barr and Lambright, 2010; Marat et al, 2011; Ishida et al, 2016).

Serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b and 4b make up more than 95% of isolates from humans, with serotype 4b causing most of the food-borne outbreaks. Listeria monocytogenes enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion of contaminated food. The bacteria can survive food preservation procedures, such as refrigeration, low pH and high salt.Listeria monocytogenes expresses several adhesin proteins at the cell surface that facilitate bacterial binding and entry to host cells. The bacteria can enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlA (internalin) protein to CDH1 (E-cadherin) at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes can also enter host cells through endocytosis mediated by binding of the bacterial InlB protein to MET receptor tyrosine kinase at the host cell plasma membrane. Listeria monocytogenes proliferates inside the host cells and triggers formation of?filopods, elongated protrusions of the host plasma membrane that contain bacteria. Filopods are ingested by adjacent cells, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to spread from cell to cell, invisible to the immune system of the host.Listeria monocytogenes can cross the intestinal, blood-brain and placental barriers. In immunocompetent adults Listeria monocytogenes infection usually causes gastroenteritis. In infants infected in utero and in immunocompromised adults Listeria monocytogenes infection can result in meningoencephalitis and bacteremia (sepsis).InlA is critical for crossing the intestinal barrier while both InlA and InlB are needed for crossing the placental barrier (Gessain et al. 2015) and, based on in vitro studies, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Grundler et al. 2013). It seems that the intrinsic level of PI3K activity in Listeria-targeted host cells determines whether the entry depends on InlA only or InlA and InlB. The interaction of InlA with E-cadherin does not activate PI3K/AKT signaling while the interaction of InlB with the MET receptor activated the PI3K/AKT signal transduction cascade. Therefore, InlB-MET interaction may be important in tissues with low intrinsic PI3K activity (Gessain et al. 2015). Even if InlA-E-cadherin route is sufficient for bacterial entry, InlB may accelerate bacterial invasion (Pentecost et al. 2010). Cholesterol levels in host cell plasma membrane may also influence the preferred route for bacterial endocytosis (Seveau et al. 2004). In addition to InlA and InlB, many other virulence factors are involved in the Listeria monocytogenes infection cycle (Camejo et al. 2011) and will be annotated as mechanistic details become available.For review, please refer to Bonazzi et al. 2009, Brooks et al. 2010, Camejo et al. 2011, Pizarro-Cerda et al. 2012.",NA,

All RUNX family members, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3, possess a highly conserved Runt domain, involved in DNA binding. For a more detailed description of the structure of RUNX proteins, please refer to the pathway 'Transcriptional regulation by RUNX1'. Similar to RUNX1 and RUNX2, RUNX3 forms a transcriptionally active heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta). Studies in mice have shown that RUNX3 plays a role in neurogenesis and development of T lymphocytes. RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in various human malignancies.During nervous system formation, the Cbfb:Runx3 complex is involved in development of mouse proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons by regulating expression of Ntrk3 (Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3) and possibly other genes (Inoue et al. 2002, Kramer et al. 2006, Nakamura et al. 2008, Dykes et al. 2011, Ogihara et al. 2016). It is not yet known whether RUNX3 is involved in human neuronal development?and neuronal disorders.RUNX3 plays a major role in immune response. RUNX3 regulates development of T lymphocytes. In mouse hematopoietic stem cells, expression of Runx3 is regulated by the transcription factor TAL1 (Landry et al. 2008). RUNX3 promotes the CD8+ lineage fate in developing thymocytes. In the CD4+ thymocyte lineage in mice, the transcription factor ThPOK induces transcription of SOCS family members, which repress Runx3 expression (Luckey et al. 2014). RUNX3, along with RUNX1 and ETS1, is implicated in regulation of transcription of the CD6 gene, encoding a lymphocyte surface receptor expressed on developing and mature T cells (Arman et al. 2009). RUNX3 and ThPOK regulate intestinal CD4+ T cell immunity in a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent manner, which is important for cellular defense against intestinal pathogens (Reis et al. 2013). Besides T lymphocytes, RUNX3 is a key transcription factor in the commitment of innate lymphoid cells ILC1 and ILC3 (Ebihara et al. 2015). RUNX3 regulates expression of CD11A and CD49D integrin genes, involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2005). RUNX3 is involved in mouse TGF-beta-mediated dendritic cell function and its deficiency is linked to airway inflammation (Fainaru et al. 2004).In addition to its developmental role, RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor. The loss of RUNX3 expression and function was first causally linked to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). Expression of RUNX3 increases in human pancreatic islet of Langerhans cells but not in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in response to differentiation stimulus (serum withdrawal) (Levkovitz et al. 2010). Hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene is associated with an increased risk for progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Schulmann et al. 2005). Hypermethylation-mediated silencing of the RUNX3 gene expression is also frequent in granulosa cell tumors (Dhillon et al. 2004) and has also been reported in colon cancer (Weisenberger et al. 2006), breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006, Huang et al. 2012), bladder cancer (Wolff et al. 2008) and gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). In colorectal cancer, RUNX3 is one of the five markers in a gene panel used to classify CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+) (Weisenberger et al. 2006).RUNX3 and CBFB are frequently downregulated in gastric cancer. RUNX3 cooperates with TGF-beta to maintain homeostasis in the stomach and is involved in TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest of stomach epithelial cells. Runx3 knockout mice exhibit decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta and develop gastric epithelial hyperplasia (Li et al. 2002, Chi et al. 2005). RUNX3-mediated inhibition of binding of TEADs:YAP1 complexes to target promoters is also implicated in gastric cancer suppression (Qiao et al. 2016).RUNX3 is a negative regulator of NOTCH signaling and RUNX3-mediated inhibition of NOTCH activity may play a tumor suppressor role in hepatocellular carcinoma (Gao et al. 2010, Nishina et al. 2011).In addition to RUNX3 silencing through promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006), Runx3+/- mice are predisposed to breast cancer development. RUNX3 downregulates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) protein levels in a proteasome-dependent manner (Huang et al. 2012).Besides its tumor suppressor role, mainly manifested through its negative effect on cell proliferation, RUNX3 can promote cancer cell invasion by stimulating expression of genes involved in metastasis, such as osteopontin (SPP1) (Whittle et al. 2015).",NA,

RUNX2 mainly regulates transcription of genes involved in skeletal development (reviewed in Karsenty 2008). RUNX2 is involved in development of both intramembraneous and endochondral bones through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, respectively. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the BGLAP gene (Ducy and Karsenty 1995, Ducy et al. 1997), which encodes Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone which is one of the most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed in Karsenty and Olson 2016). RUNX2 directly controls the expression of most genes associated with osteoblast differentiation and function (Sato et al. 1998, Ducy et al. 1999, Roce et al. 2005). RUNX2-mediated transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in GPCR (G?protein coupled receptor) signaling is implicated in the control of growth of osteoblast progenitors (Teplyuk et al. 2009). RUNX2 promotes chondrocyte maturation by stimulating transcription of the IHH gene, encoding Indian hedgehog (Takeda et al. 2001, Yoshida et al. 2004). Germline loss-of-function mutations of the RUNX2 gene are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (CCD), an autosomal skeletal disorder (reviewed in Jaruga et al. 2016). The function of RUNX2 is frequently disrupted in osteosarcoma (reviewed in Mortus et al. 2014). Vitamin D3 is implicated in regulation of transcriptional activity of the RUNX2:CBFB complex (Underwood et al. 2012).RUNX2 expression is regulated by estrogen signaling, and RUNX2 is implicated in breast cancer development and metastasis (reviewed in Wysokinski et al. 2014). Besides estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) (Kammerer et al. 2013), RUNX2 transcription is also regulated by TWIST1 (Yang, Yang et al. 2011), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) (Zhang et al. 2012), NKX3-2 (BAPX1) (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999, Lengner et al. 2005), DLX5 (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005) and MSX2 (Lee et al. 2005). RUNX2 can autoregulate, by directly inhibiting its own transcription (Drissi et al. 2000). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases target RUNX2 for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016). Besides formation of RUNX2:CBFB heterodimers, transcriptional activity of RUNX2 is regulated by binding to a number of other transcription factors, for example SOX9 (Zhou et al. 2006, TWIST1 (Bialek et al. 2004) and RB1 (Thomas et al. 2001).RUNX2 regulates expression of several genes implicated in cell migration during normal development and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the ITGA5 gene, encoding Integrin alpha 5 (Li et al. 2016) and the ITGBL1 gene, encoding Integrin beta like protein 1 (Li et al. 2015). RUNX2 mediated transcription of the MMP13 gene, encoding Colagenase 3 (Matrix metalloproteinase 13), is stimulated by AKT mediated phosphorylation of RUNX2 (Pande et al. 2013). RUNX2 is implicated in positive regulation of AKT signaling by stimulating expression of AKT-activating TORC2 complex components MTOR and RICTOR, which may contribute to survival of breast cancer cells (Tandon et al. 2014).RUNX2 inhibits CDKN1A transcription, thus preventing CDKN1A-induced cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation of RUNX2 by CDK4 in response to high glucose enhances RUNX2-mediated repression of the CDKN1A gene in endothelial cells (Pierce et al. 2012). In mice, Runx2-mediated repression of Cdkn1a may contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kuo et al. 2009). RUNX2 can stimulate transcription of the LGALS3 gene, encoding Galectin-3 (Vladimirova et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). Galectin 3 is expressed in myeloid progenitors and its levels increase during the maturation process (Le Marer 2000).For a review of RUNX2 function, please refer to Long 2012 and Ito et al. 2015.",NA,

In addition to RUNX1, its heterodimerization partner CBFB is also frequently mutated in AML (Shigesada et al. 2004, Mangan and Speck 2011).The core domain of CBFB binds to the Runt domain of RUNX1, resulting in formation of the RUNX1:CBFB heterodimer. CBFB does not interact with DNA directly. The Runt domain of RUNX1 mediated both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFB (Tahirov et al. 2001), while RUNX1 regions that flank the Runt domain are involved in transactivation (reviewed in Zhang et al. 2003) and negative regulation (autoinhibition). CBFB facilitates RUNX1 binding to DNA by stabilizing Runt domain regions that interact with the major and minor grooves of the DNA (Tahirov et al. 2001, Backstrom?et al. 2002, Bartfeld et al. 2002). The transactivation domain of RUNX1 is located C-terminally to the Runt domain and is followed by the negative regulatory domain. Autoinhibiton of RUNX1 is relieved by interaction with CBFB (Kanno et al. 1998).Transcriptional targets of the RUNX1:CBFB complex involve genes that regulate self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Zhao et al. 2014), as well as commitment and differentiation of many hematopoietic progenitors, including myeloid (Friedman 2009) and megakaryocytic progenitors (Goldfarb 2009), regulatory T lymphocytes (Wong et al. 2011) and B lymphocytes (Boller and Grosschedl 2014).RUNX1 binds to promoters of many genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis (Ribi) and is thought to stimulate their transcription. RUNX1 loss-of-function decreases ribosome biogenesis and translation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RUNX1 loss-of-function is therefore associated with a slow growth, but at the same time it results in reduced apoptosis and increases resistance of cells to genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stress, conferring an overall selective advantage to RUNX1 deficient HSPCs (Cai et al. 2015).RUNX1 is implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 forms a complex with the activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and regulates expression of estrogen-responsive genes (Chimge and Frenkel 2013).RUNX1 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma where it may contribute to cell proliferation, migration and invasion (Keita et al. 2013).RUNX1 may cooperate with TP53 in transcriptional activation of TP53 target genes upon DNA damage (Wu et al. 2013).RUNX1 is needed for the maintenance of skeletal musculature (Wang et al. 2005).During mouse embryonic development, Runx1 is expressed in most nociceptive sensory neurons, which are involved in the perception of pain. In adult mice, Runx1 is expressed only in nociceptive sensory neurons that express the Ret receptor and is involved in regulation of expression of genes encoding ion channels (sodium-gated, ATP-gated and hydrogen ion-gated) and receptors (thermal receptors, opioid receptor MOR and the Mrgpr class of G protein coupled receptors). Mice lacking Runx1 show defective perception of thermal and neuropathic pain (Chen CL et al. 2006). Runx1 is thought to activate the neuronal differentiation of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion cells during embryonal development possibly through repression of Hes1 expression (Kobayashi et al. 2012). In chick and mouse embryos, Runx1 expression is restricted to the dorso-medial domain of the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkA-positive cutaneous sensory neurons. Runx3 expression in chick and mouse embryos is restricted to ventro-lateral domain of the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkC-positive proprioceptive neurons (Chen AI et al. 2006, Kramer et al. 2006).

GABA is synthesized by two distinct enzymes GAD67 and GAD65 that differ in their cellular localization, functional properties and co-factor requirements. GABA synthesized by GAD65 is used for neurotransmission whereas GABA synthesized by GAD67 is used for processes other than neurotransmission such as synaptogenesis and protection against neuronal injury. GABA is loaded into synaptic vesicle with the help of vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter or VGAT. GAD65 and VGAT are functionally linked at the synaptic vesicle membrane and GABA synthesized by GAD65 is preferentially loaded into the synaptic vesicle over GABA synthesized in cytoplasm by GAD67.The GABA loaded synaptic vesicles are docked at the plasma membrane?with the help of the SNARE complexes and primed by interplay between various proteins including Munc18, complexin etc. Release of GABA loaded synaptic vesicle is initiated by the arrival of action potential at the presynaptic bouton and opening of N or P/Q voltage gated Ca2+ channels.

P1 is more than 7 kb upstream of P2 (Ghozi et al. 1996). In mice, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the proximal P2 promoter during generation of hematopoietic cells from hemogenic endothelium. In fully committed hematopoietic progenitors, the Runx1 gene is preferentially transcribed from the distal P1 promoter (Sroczynska et al. 2009, Bee et al. 2010). In human T cells, RUNX1 is preferentially transcribed from P1 throughout development, while developing natural killer cells transcribe RUNX1 predominantly from P2. Developing B cells transcribe low levels of RUNX1 from both promoters (Telfer and Rothenberg 2001).RUNX1 mRNAs transcribed from alternative promoters differ in their 5'UTRs and splicing isoforms of RUNX1 have also been described. The function of alternative splice isoforms and alternative 5'UTRs?has not been fully elucidated (Challen and Goodell 2010, Komeno et al. 2014).During zebrafish hematopoiesis, RUNX1 expression increases in response to NOTCH signaling, but direct transcriptional regulation of RUNX1 by NOTCH has not been demonstrated (Burns et al. 2005). RUNX1 transcription also increases in response to WNT signaling. BothTCF7 and TCF4 bind the RUNX1 promoter (Wu et al. 2012, Hoverter et al. 2012), and RUNX1 transcription driven by the TCF binding element (TBE) in response to WNT3A treatment is inhibited by the dominant-negative mutant of TCF4 (Medina et al. 2016). In developing mouse ovary, Runx1 expression is positively regulated by Wnt4 signaling (Naillat et al. 2015).Studies in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells imply that RUNX1 may be a direct transcriptional target of HOXB4 (Oshima et al. 2011).Conserved cis-regulatory elements were recently identified in intron 5 of RUNX1. The RUNX1 breakpoints observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation (8;21), which result in expression of a fusion RUNX1-ETO protein, cluster in intron 5, in proximity to these not yet fully characterized cis regulatory elements (Rebolledo-Jaramillo et al. 2014).At the level of translation, RUNX1 expression is regulated by various microRNAs which bind to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and inhibit its translation through endonucleolytic and/or nonendonucleolytic mechanisms. MicroRNAs that target RUNX1 include miR-378 (Browne et al. 2016), miR-302b (Ge et al. 2014), miR-18a (Miao et al. 2015), miR-675 (Zhuang et al. 2014), miR-27a (Ben-Ami et al. 2009), miR-17, miR-20a, miR106 (Fontana et al. 2007) and miR-215 (Li et al. 2016).At the posttranslational level, RUNX1 activity is regulated by postranslational modifications and binding to co-factors. SRC family kinases phosphorylate RUNX1 on multiple tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory domain, involved in autoinhibition of RUNX1. RUNX1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with reduced binding of RUNX1 to GATA1 and increased binding of RUNX1 to the SWI/SNF complex, leading to inhibition of RUNX1-mediated differentiation of T-cells and megakaryocytes. SHP2 (PTPN11) tyrosine phosphatase binds to RUNX1 and dephosphorylates it (Huang et al. 2012).Formation of the complex with CBFB is necessary for the transcriptional activity of RUNX1 (Wang et al. 1996). Binding of CCND3 and probably other two cyclin D family members, CCND1 and CCND2, to RUNX1 inhibits its association with CBFB (Peterson et al. 2005), while binding to CDK6 interferes with binding of RUNX1 to DNA without affecting formation of the RUNX1:CBFB complex. Binding of RUNX1 to PML plays a role in subnuclear targeting of RUNX1 (Nguyen et al. 2005).RUNX1 activity and protein levels vary during the cell cycle. RUNX1 protein levels increase from G1 to S and from S to G2 phases, with no increase in RUNX1 mRNA levels. CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of RUNX1 at the G2/M transition is implicated in reduction of RUNX1 transactivation potency and may promote RUNX1 protein degradation by the anaphase promoting complex (reviewed by Friedman 2009).",NA,

The digestion of starch begins with the action of amylase enzymes secreted in the saliva and small intestine, which convert it to maltotriose, maltose, limit dextrins, and some glucose. Digestion of the limit dextrins and disaccharides, both dietary and starch-derived, to monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, and fructose - is accomplished by enzymes located on the luminal?surfaces of enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine.Dietary protein is hydrolyzed to dipeptides and amino acids by the action of pepsin in the stomach and an array of intestinal hydrolases. All of these enzymes are released in inactive (proenzyme) forms and activated by proteolytic cleavage within the gastrointestinal lumen (Van Beers et al. 1995; Yamada 2015).",NA,

Similar to the RUNX1 gene, the RUNX2 gene expression can be regulated from the proximal P2 promoter or the distal P1 promoter (reviewed in Li and Xiao 2007).Activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) binds estrogen response elements (EREs) in the P2 promoter and stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013). Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) binds EREs or estrogen-related response elements (ERREs) in the P2 promoter of RUNX2. When ERRA is bound to its co-factor PPARG1CA (PGC1A), it stimulates RUNX2 transcription. When bound to its co-factor PPARG1CB (PGC1B), ERRA represses RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013).TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, stimulates RUNX2 transcription by binding to the E1-box in the P2 promoter (Yang, Yang et al. 2011). TWIST proteins also interact with the DNA-binding domain of RUNX2 to modulate its activity during skeletogenesis?(Bialek et al. 2004). Schnurri-3 (SHN3) is another protein that interacts with RUNX2 to decrease its availability in the nucleus and therefore its activity (Jones et al. 2006). In contrast, RUNX2 and SATB2 interact to enhance the expression of osteoblast-specific genes (Dobreva et al. 2006). Formation of the heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta) also enhances the transcriptional activity of RUNX2 (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002).Transcription of RUNX2 from the proximal promoter is inhibited by binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) activated by dexamethasone (DEXA) to a glucocorticoid receptor response element (GRE), which is also present in the human promoter (Zhang et al. 2012).NKX3-2 (BAPX1), required for embryonic development of the axial skeleton (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999), binds the distal (P1) promoter of the RUNX2 gene and inhibits its transcription (Lengner et al. 2005). RUNX2-P1 transcription is also autoinhibited by RUNX2-P1, which binds to RUNX2 response elements in the P1 promoter of RUNX2 (Drissi et al. 2000). In contrast, binding of RUNX2-P2 to the proximal P2 promoter autoactivates transcription of RUNX2-P2 (Ducy et al. 1999). Binding of a homeodomain transcription factor DLX5, and possibly DLX6, to the RUNX2 P1 promoter stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005). The homeobox transcription factor MSX2 can bind to DLX5 sites in the promoter of RUNX2 and inhibit transcription of RUNX2-P1 (Lee et al. 2005).Translocation of RUNX2 protein to the nucleus is inhibited by binding to non-activated STAT1 (Kim et al. 2003).Several E3 ubiquitin ligases were shown to polyubiquitinate RUNX2, targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016).",NA,

Binding of the RUNX2:CBFB complex to the BGLAP gene promoter is increased when RUNX2 is phosphorylated on serine residue S451 (Wee et al. 2002). Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, is one of the most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed in Karsenty and Olson 2016). Association of the activated androgen receptor (AR) with RUNX2 prevents binding of RUNX2 to the BGLAP promoter (Baniwal et al. 2009). When YAP1, tyrosine phosphorylated by SRC and/or YES1, binds to RUNX2 at the BGLAP gene promoter, transcription of the BGLAP gene is inhibited (Zaidi et al. 2004). Signaling by SRC is known to inhibit osteoblast differentiation (Marzia et al. 2000).Simultaneous binding of RUNX2 and SP7 (Osterix, also known as OSX) to adjacent RUNX2 and SP7?binding sites, respectively, in the UCMA promoter, synergistically activates UCMA transcription. UCMA stimulates osteoblast differentiation and formation of mineralized nodules (Lee et al. 2015).The SCF(SKP2) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex inhibits differentiation of osteoblasts by polyubiquitinating RUNX2 and targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Thacker et al. 2016).

The directional nature of NOX2 activity creates a charge imbalance that must be counteracted to prevent depolarization of the membrane and the shutdown of activity (Winterbourn CC et al. 2016). Also, protons are produced in the cytosol and consumed in the external compartment (for example, the phagosome) through the dismutation of superoxide. Both situations are largely overcome by a balancing flow of protons transported by voltage-gated proton channels, primarily VSOP/HV1, which are activated in parallel with the oxidase (Demaurex N & El Chemaly A 2010; El Chemaly A et al. 2010; Petheo GL et al. 2010; Kovacs I et al. 2014; Henderson LM et al. 1987, 1988). The pH of the phagosome is regulated by these activities. In contrast to the phagosomes of macrophages, in which pH drops following particle ingestion,?neutrophil phagosomes remain alkaline during the period that the oxidase is active. Until recently, their pH has been accepted to lie between 7.5 and 8.

Several ubiquitin proteases, such as USP13 and OTUD3, can remove polyubiquitin chains from PTEN and rescue it from degradation (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015). TRIM27 (RFP) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates PTEN on multiple lysines in the C2 domain of PTEN using K27 linkage between ubiquitin molecules. TRIM27 mediated ubiquitination inhibits PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, but does not affect PTEN protein localization or stability (Lee et al. 2013).PTEN phosphorylation by the tyrosine kinase FRK (RAK) inhibits NEDD4 mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN, thus increasing PTEN half life. FRK mediated?phosphorylation also increases PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009). Casein kinase 2 (CK2) mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminus of PTEN on multiple serine and threonine residues increases PTEN protein stability (Torres and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (Miller et al. 2002).PREX2, a RAC1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) can binds to PTEN and inhibit its catalytic activity (Fine et al. 2009).",NA,

In the matrix, Ca2+ binds and allosterically regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and possibly other enzymes (Rizzuto et al. 2012). Matrix calcium is also observed to regulate release of caspase cofactors and calcium flux through channels on neighboring membranes, The pathway into the mitochondrion involves VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 in the outer membrane and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex in the inner membrane. VDACs in the open conformation are anion channels. However in the closed conformation they transport Ca2+ from the cytosol to the intermembrane space. When calcium concentrations in the cytosol and intermembrane space are high, the MCU complex opens and transports Ca2+ from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial?matrix using the driving force of the membrane potential (reviewed in Drago et al. 2011, Marchi et al. 2014, De Stefani et al. 2015).Efflux of Ca2+ from the matrix to the intermembrane space is catalyzed by the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter SLC8B1 (NCLX) located in the inner membrane.

The best characterized target of neddylation is the cullin scaffold subunit of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which themselves target numerous cellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Hori et al, 1999; reviewed in Soucy et al, 2010; Lyedeard et al, 2013). The multisubunit CRL complexes are compositionally diverse, but each contains a scaffolding cullin protein (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, 7 or 9) and a RING box-containing E3 ligase subunit RBX, along with other adaptor and substrate-interacting subunits. RBX2 (also known as RNF7) interacts preferentially with CUL5, while RBX1 is the primary E3 for most other cullin family members (reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014). Neddylation of the cullin subunit increases the ubiquitination activity of the CRL complex (Podust et al, 2000; Read et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2000; Kawakami et al, 2001;Â Ohh et al, 2002; Yu et al, 2015). In addition to CRL complexes, a number of other less-well characterized NEDD8 targets have been identified. These include other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SMURF1 and MDM2, receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and TGF beta RII, and proteins that contribute to transcriptional regulation, among others (Xie et al, 2014; Watson et al, 2010; Oved et al, 2006; Zuo et al, 2013; Xirodimas et al, 2004; Singh et al, 2007; Abida et al, 2007; Liu et al 2010; Watson et al, 2006; Loftus et al, 2012; Aoki et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). Like ubiquitin, NEDD8 undergoes post-translational processing to generate the mature form. UCHL3- or SENP8-mediated proteolysis removes the C-terminal 5 amino acids of NEDD8, generating a novel C-terminal glycine residue for conjugation to the cysteine residues in the E1, E2 enzymes or lysine residues in the substrate protein, usually the E3 NEDD8 ligase itself (Wada et al, 1998; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). Most substrates in vivo appear to be singly neddylated on one or more lysine residues, but NEDD8 chains have been formed on cullin substrates in vitro and on histone H4 in cultured human cells after DNA damage (Jones et al, 2008; Ohki et al, 2009; Xirodimas et al, 2008; Jeram et al, 2010; Ma et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). The significance of NEDD8 chains is still not clear. NEDD8 has a single heterodimeric E1 enzyme, consisting of NAE1 (also known as APPBP1) and UBA3, and two E2 enzymes, UBE2M and UBE2F, which are N-terminally acetylated (Walden et al, 2003; Bohnsack et al, 2003; Huang et al, 2004; Huang et al, 2005; Huang et al, 2009; Scott et al, 2011a; Monda et al, 2013; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2015). All NEDD8 E3 enzymes reported to date also function as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and most belong to the RING domain class. The best characterized NEDD8 E3 enzymes are the CRL complexes described above. RBX1-containing complexes interact preferentially with UBE2M, while UBE2F is the E2 for RBX2-containing complexes (Huang et al, 2009; Monda et al, 2013). Neddylation is regulated in vivo by interaction with DCUN1D proteins (also called DCNLs). The 5 human DCUN1D proteins interact both with cullins and with the NEDD8 E2 proteins and thereby increase the kinetic efficiency of neddylation (Kurz et al, 2005; Kurz et al, 2008; Scott et al, 2010; Scott et al, 2011a; Scott et al, 2014; Monda et al, 2013). Glomulin (GLMN) is another regulator of CRL function that binds to the neddylated cullin and competitively inhibits interaction with the ubiquitin E2 enzyme (Arai et al, 2003; Tron et al, 2012; Duda et al, 2012; reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).The multisubunit COP9 signalosome is the only cullin deneddylase, while SENP8 (also known as DEN1) contributes to deneddylation of other non-cullin NEDD8 targets (Cope et al, 2002; Emberley et al, 2012; Chan et al, 2008; Wu et al, 2003; reviewed in Wei et al, 2008; Enchev et al, 2015). In the deneddylated state, cullins bind to CAND1 (cullin associated NEDD8-dissociated protein1), which displaces the COP9 signalosome and promotes the exchange of the ubiquitin substrate-specific adaptor.

These changes convert them to chylomicron remnants which bind to LDL receptors, primarily on the surfaces of liver cells, clearing them from the circulation (Redgrave 2004).Most very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) are converted to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (VLDL remodeling pathway). A small fraction are taken up by VLDL receptors on extrahepatic cells, as annotated here. Clearance of LDL from the blood involves binding to LDL receptors associated with coated pits at the cell surface, forming complexes that are internalized and passed via clathrin-coated vesicles to endosomes, where they dissociate. The LDL particles move into lysosomes and are degraded while the LDL receptors are returned to the cell surface. This process occurs in most cell types but is especially prominent in hepatocytes.

A central part in this regulation is played by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a neutral lipase abundant in adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also abundant in ovarian and adrenal tissue, where it mediates cholesterol ester hydrolysis, yielding cholesterol for steroid biosynthesis. The hormones to which it is sensitive include catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine), ACTH, and glucagon, all of which trigger signaling cascades that lead to its phosphorylation and activation, and insulin, which sets off events leading?to its dephosphorylation and inactivation (Kraemer & Shen 2002).The processes of triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis are also regulated by subcellular compartmentalization: these lipids are packaged in cytosolic particles and the enzymes responsible for their hydrolysis, and perhaps for additional steps in their metabolism, are organized at the surfaces of these particles (e.g., Brasaemle et al. 2004)",NA,

Glycogen metabolism has been studied in most detail in liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen metabolism in other tissues has not been studied as extensively, and is thought to resemble the muscle process.Glycogen synthesis involves five reactions. The first two, conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate and synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP, are shared with several other pathways. The next three reactions, the auto-catalyzed synthesis of a glucose oligomer on glycogenin, the linear extension of the glucose oligomer catalyzed by glycogen synthase, and the formation of branches catalyzed by glycogen branching enzyme, are unique to glycogen synthesis. Repetition of the last two reactions generates large, extensively branched glycogen polymers. The catalysis of glycogenin glucosylation?and oligoglucose chain extension by distinct isozymes in liver and nonhepatic tissues allows them to be regulated independently (Agius 2008; Bollen et al. 1998; Roach et al. 2012).Cytosolic glycogen breakdown occurs via the same chemical steps in all tissues but is separately regulated via tissue specific isozymes and signaling pathways that enable distinct physiological fates for glycogen in liver and other tissues. Glycogen phosphorylase, which can be activated by phosphorylase kinase, catalyzes the removal of glucose residues as glucose 1-phosphate from the ends of glycogen branches. The final four residues of each branch are removed in two steps catalyzed by debranching enzyme, and further glycogen phosphorylase activity completes the process of glycogen breakdown. The first glucose residue in each branch is released as free glucose; all other residues are released as glucose 1-phosphate. The latter molecule can be converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a step shared with other pathways (Villar-Palasi & Larner 1970; Hers 1976).Glycogen can also be taken up into lysosomes, where it is normally broken done by the action of a single enzyme, lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (GAA) (Brown et al. 1970).",NA,

OAS1, 2, and 3 are activated by double-stranded RNA to synthesize 5'-triphosphorylated 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP (Kerr IM & Brown RE 1978). The 2-5A serve as chemically unique second messengers that induce regulated RNA decay by activating ribonuclease L (RNase L), thus mediating antiviral innate immunity (Zhou A et al. 1993; Lin RJ et al. 2009; Huang H et al. 2014; Han Y et al. 2014).

The MECP2 gene locus consists of four exons. Both exon 1 and exon 2 contain translation start sites. Alternative splicing of the second exon results in expression of two MECP2 transcript isoforms, MECP2_e1 (MECP2B or MECP2alpha) and MECP2_e2 (MECP2A or MECP2beta). The N-terminus of the MECP2_e1 isoform, in which exon 2 is spliced out, is encoded by exon 1. The N-terminus of the MECP2_e2 isoforms, which includes both exon 1 and exon 2, is encoded by exon 2, as the exon 2 translation start site is used. Exons 3 and 4 are present in both isoforms. The MECP2_e2 isoform was cloned first and is therefore more extensively studied. The MECP2_e1 isoform is more abundant in the brain (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004, Kriaucionis and Bird 2004, Kaddoum et al. 2013). Mecp2 isoforms show different expression patterns during mouse brain development and in adult brain regions (Dragich?et al. 2007, Olson et al. 2014). While Rett syndrome mutations mainly occur in exons 3 and 4 of MECP2, thereby affecting both MECP2 isoforms (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004), some mutations occur in exon 1, affecting MECP2_e1 only. No mutations have been described in exon 2 (Gianakopoulos et al. 2012). Knockout of Mecp2_e1 isoform in mice, through a naturally occurring Rett syndrome point mutation which affects the first translation codon of MECP2_e1, recapitulates Rett-like phenotype. Knockout of Mecp2_e2 isoform in mice does not result in impairment of neurologic functions (Yasui et al. 2014). In Mecp2 null mice, transgenic expression of either Mecp2_e1 or Mecp2_e2 prevents development of Rett-like phenotype, with Mecp2_e1 rescuing more Rett-like symptoms than Mecp2_e2. This indicates that both splice variants can fulfill basic Mecp2 functions in the mouse brain (Kerr et al. 2012). Changes in gene expression upon over-expression of either MECP2_e1 or MECP2_e2 imply overlapping as well as distinct target genes (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014).Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 encoded by the MECP2 gene binds to methylated CpG sequences in the DNA. The binding is not generic, however, but is affected by the underlying DNA sequence (Yoon et al. 2003). MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 methylcytosine (5mC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional repression (Mellen et al. 2012), both in the context of CpG islands and outside of CpG islands (Chen et al. 2015). In addition, MECP2 binds to DNA containing 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC DNA), a DNA modification associated with transcriptional activation (Mellen et al. 2012). MECP2 binds to DNA as a monomer, occupying about 11 bp of the DNA. Binding of one MECP2 molecule facilitates binding of the second MECP2 molecule, and therefore clustering can occur at target sites. MECP2 binding to chromatin may be facilitated by nucleosome methylation (Ghosh et al. 2010).MECP2 was initially proposed to act as a generic repressor of gene transcription. However, high throughput studies of MECP2-induced changes in gene expression in mouse hippocampus (Chahrour et al. 2008), and mouse and human cell lines (Orlic-Milacic et al. 2014) indicate that more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated when MECP2 is overexpressed. At least for some genes directly upregulated by MECP2, it was shown that a complex of MECP2 and CREB1 was involved in transcriptional stimulation (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013).MECP2 expression is the highest in postmitotic neurons compared to other cell types, with MECP2 being almost as abundant as core histones. Phosphorylation of MECP2 in response to neuronal activity regulates binding of MECP2 to DNA, suggesting that MECP2 may remodel chromatin in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. The resulting changes in gene expression would then modulate synaptic plasticity and behavior (reviewed by Ebert and Greenberg 2013). In human embryonic stem cell derived Rett syndrome neurons, loss of MECP2 is associated with a significant reduction in transcription of neuronally active genes, as well as the reduction in nascent protein synthesis. The reduction in nascent protein synthesis can at least in part be attributed to the decreased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Neuronal morphology (reduced soma size) and the level of protein synthesis in Rett neurons can be ameliorated by treating the cells with growth factors which activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade or by inhibition of PTEN, the negative regulator of AKT activation. Mitochondrial gene expression is also downregulated in Rett neurons, which is associated with a reduced capacity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Ricciardi et al. 2011, Li et al. 2013). Treatment of Mecp2 null mice with IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) reverses or ameliorates some Rett-like features such as locomotion, respiratory difficulties and irregular heart rate (Tropea et al. 2009).MECP2 regulates expression of a number of ligands and receptors involved in neuronal development and function. Ligands regulated by MECP2 include BDNF (reviewed by Li and Pozzo-Miller 2014, and KhorshidAhmad et al. 2016), CRH (McGill et al. 2006, Samaco et al. 2012), SST (Somatostatin) (Chahrour et al. 2008), and DLL1 (Li et al. 2014). MECP2 also regulates transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA ¨C GAD1 (Chao et al. 2010) and GAD2 (Chao et al. 2010, He et al. 2014). MECP2 may be involved in direct stimulation of transcription from the GLUD1 gene promoter, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 1, which may be involved in the turnover of the neurotransmitter glutamate (Livide et al. 2015). Receptors regulated by MECP2 include glutamate receptor GRIA2 (Qiu et al. 2012), NMDA receptor subunits GRIN2A (Durand et al. 2012) and GRIN2B (Lee et al. 2008), opioid receptors OPRK1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and OPRM1 (Hwang et al. 2009, Hwang et al. 2010, Samaco et al. 2012), GPRIN1 (Chahrour et al. 2008), MET (Plummer et al. 2013), NOTCH1 (Li et al. 2014). Channels/transporters regulated by MECP2 include TRPC3 (Li et al. 2012) and SLC2A3 (Chen et al. 2013). MECP2 regulates transcription of FKBP5, involved in trafficking of glucocorticoid receptors (Nuber et al. 2005, Urdinguio et al. 2008). MECP2 is implicated in regulation of expression of SEMA3F (semaphorin 3F) in mouse olfactory neurons (Degano et al. 2009). In zebrafish, Mecp2 is implicated in sensory axon guidance by direct stimulation of transcription of Sema5b and Robo2 (Leong et al. 2015). MECP2 may indirectly regulate signaling by neuronal receptor tyrosine kinases by regulating transcription of protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTPN1 (Krishnan et al. 2015) and PTPN4 (Williamson et al. 2015).MECP2 regulates transcription of several transcription factors involved in functioning of the nervous system, such as CREB1, MEF2C, RBFOX1 (Chahrour et al. 2008) and PPARG (Mann et al. 2010, Joss-Moore et al. 2011).MECP2 associates with transcription and chromatin remodeling factors, such as CREB1 (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013), the HDAC1/2-containing SIN3A co-repressor complex (Nan et al. 1998), and the NCoR/SMRT complex (Lyst et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013). There are contradictory reports on the interaction of MECP2 with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (Harikrishnan et al. 2005, Hu et al. 2006). Interaction of MECP2 with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 has been reported, with a concomitant increase in enzymatic activity of DNMT1 (Kimura and Shiota 2003).In addition to DNA binding-dependent regulation of gene expression by MECP2, MECP2 may influence gene expression by interaction with components of the DROSHA microprocessor complex and the consequent change in the levels of mature microRNAs (Cheng et al. 2014, Tsujimura et al. 2015).Increased MECP2 promoter methylation is observed in both male and female autism patients (Nagarajan et al. 2008). Regulatory elements that undergo methylation are found in the promoter and the first intron of MECP2 and their methylation was shown to regulate Mecp2 expression in mice (Liyanage et al. 2013). Mouse Mecp2 promoter methylation was shown to be affected by stress (Franklin et al. 2010).The Rett-like phenotype of Mecp2 null mice is reversible (Guy et al. 2007), but appropriate levels of Mecp2 expression need to be achieved (Alvarez-Saavedra et al. 2007). When Mecp2 expression is restored in astrocytes of Mecp2 null mice, amelioration of Rett symptoms occurs, involving non-cell-autonomous positive effect on mutant neurons and increasing level of the excitatory glutamate transporter VGLUT1 (Lioy et al. 2011). Microglia derived from Mecp2 null mice releases higher than normal levels of glutamate, which has toxic effect on neurons. Increased glutamate secretion may be due to increased levels of glutaminase (Gls), involved in glutamate synthesis, and increased levels of connexin-32 (Gjb1), involved in glutamate release, in Mecp2 null microglia (Maezawa and Jin 2010). Targeted deletion of Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons of the mouse hypothalamus recapitulates some Rett syndrome-like features and highlights the role of Mecp2 in feeding behavior and response to stress (Fyffe et al. 2008).Mecp2 overexpression, similar to MECP2 duplication syndrome, causes neurologic phenotype similar to Rett (Collins et al. 2004, Luikenhuis et al. 2004, Van Esch et al. 2005, Alvarez-Saavedra 2007, Van Esch et al. 2012). The phenotype of the mouse model of the MECP2 duplication syndrome in adult mice is reversible when Mecp2 expression levels are corrected (Sztainberg et al. 2015).",NA,

Besides NTRK2, the family includes NTRK1 (TRKA) and NTRK3 (TRKC). Similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), NTRK2 is activated by ligand binding to its extracellular domain. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, followed by trans-autophosphorylation of dimerized receptors on conserved tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region. Phosphorylated tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the receptor serve as docking sites for adapter proteins, triggering downstream signaling cascaded. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4, also known as NT-4) are two high affinity ligands for NTRK2. Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3, also known as NT-3), a high affinity ligand for NTRK3, binds to NTRK2 with low affinity and it is not clear if it the low level of activation of NTRK2 by NTF3 plays a physiologically relevant role. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a high affinity?ligand for NTRK1, does not interact with NTRK2. NTRK2 activation triggers downstream RAS, PI3K, and PLCgamma signaling cascades, thought to be involved in neuronal development in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, NTRK2 plays an important, but poorly elucidated, role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning (reviewed by Minichiello 2009). NTRK2 may modify neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission by directly phosphorylating voltage gated channels (Rogalski et al. 2000).It was recently demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 negatively regulates NTRK2 signaling and neurite outgrowth. In the presence of PTPN12, NTRK2 phosphorylation at tyrosine Y816 decreases. It has not yet been demonstrated that PTPN12 acts directly to dephosphorylate Y816 (and possibly other phosphotyrosines) of NTRK2 (Ambjorn et al. 2013).Binding of SH2D1A (SAP) to NTRK2 attenuates NTRK2 trans autophosphorylation and downstream signaling through an unknown mechanism (Lo et al. 2005).Little is known about downregulation of NTRK2 (TRKB) receptor via ubiquitin dependent pathways (Sanchez Sanchez and Arevalo 2017). CBL, a ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of many receptor tyrosine kinases, was shown to ubiquitinate and, unexpectedly, increase stability of NTRK2 (Pandya et al. 2014). NTRK2 undergoes ubiquitination by the TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. While ubiquitination by the TRAF6 complex negatively regulates NTRK2 induced AKT activation, the effect of TRAF6 mediated ubiquitination on NTRK2 protein levels has not been examined (Jadhav et al. 2008).Downregulation of the TRKB receptor may depend on the activating ligand, with BDNF inducing more rapid ubiquitination and degradation compared to NTF4 (NT 4). NTRK2 undergoes both lysosome dependent and proteasome dependent degradation upon stimulation by BDNF, while stimulation by NTF4 may protect NTRK2 from the lysosome degradation route (Proenca et al. 2016).",NA,

EPO is produced in the kidneys in response to low oxygen tension and binds a receptor, EPOR, located on progenitor cells: burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-e) cells and colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-e) cells.The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) exists in lipid rafts (reviewed in McGraw and List 2017) as a dimer pre-associated with proteins involved in downstream signaling: the tyrosine kinase JAK2, the tyrosine kinase LYN, and the scaffold protein IRS2. Binding of EPO to the EPOR dimer causes a change in conformation (reviewed in Watowich et al. 2011, Corbett et al. 2016) that activates JAK2, which then transphosphorylates JAK2 and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of EPOR. The phosphorylated EPOR serves directly?or indirectly as a docking site for signaling molecules such as STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1, PLCG2), and activators of RAS (SHC1, GRB2:SOS1, GRB2:VAV1).EPO activates 4 major signaling pathways: STAT5-activated transcription, PI3K-AKT, RAS-RAF-ERK, and PLC-PKC. JAK2-STAT5 activates expression of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) and therefore appears to be important for anti-apoptosis. PI3K-AKT appears to be important for both anti-apoptosis and proliferation. The roles of other signaling pathways are controversial but both RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PLCgamma-PKC have mitogenic effects. Phosphatases such as SHP1 are also recruited and downregulate the EPO signal.EPO also has effects outside of erythropoiesis. The EPOR is expressed in various tissues such as endothelium where it can act to stimulate growth and promote cell survival (Debeljak et al. 2014, Kim¨¢kov¨¢ et al. 2017). EPO and EPOR in the neurovascular system act via Akt, Wnt1, mTOR, SIRT1, and FOXO proteins to prevent apoptotic cell injury (reviewed in Ostrowski and Heinrich 2018, Maiese 2016) and EPO may have therapeutic value in the nervous system (Ma et al. 2016).",NA,

This family includes receptors for steroid hormones and derivatives (such as estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, Vitamin D, oxysterols and bile acids, among others) as well as receptors for retinoic acids, thyroid hormones and fatty acids and their derivatives. These ligands are able to diffuse directly through cellular membranes as a result of their lipophilic nature (reviewed in Beato et al, 1996; Holzer et al, 2017). The 48 human nuclear receptors share a conserved modular structure that consists of a sequence specific DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, in addition to various other protein-protein interaction domains. Upon interaction with ligand, NRs bind to the regulatory regions of target genes as homo- or heterodimers, or more rarely, as monomers. At the promoter, NRs interact with other activators and repressors to regulate gene expression (reviewed Beato et al, 1996; Simons et al, 2014; Hah and Kraus, 2010). A number of nuclear receptors are cytoplasmic in the absence of ligand and exist as part of a heat shock protein complex that regulates their cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria and Picard, 2010). Ligand-binding to these receptors promotes dimerization and nuclear translocation. Other nuclear receptors are contstitutively nuclear and their chromatin-modifying activities are regulated by ligand binding (reviewed in Beato et al, 1996). In addition to the classic transcriptional response, NRs also have a role in rapid, non-nuclear signaling originating from receptors localized at the plasma membrane. Ligand-binding to these receptors intitiates downstream phospholipase- and kinase-based signaling cascades (reviewed in Schwartz et al, 2016; Levin and Hammes, 2016).

In general, RTKs associate into dimers upon ligand binding and are activated by autophosphorylation on conserved intracellular tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation increases the catalytic efficiency of the receptor and provides binding sites for the assembly of downstream signaling complexes (reveiwed in Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010).

This superfamily of ligands generally binds as dimers to hetero-tetrameric cell-surface receptor serine/threonine kinases to activate SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent signaling (reviewed in Morikawa et al, 2016; Budi et al, 2017).Signaling by the TGF-beta receptor complex is initiated by TGF-beta. TGF-beta (TGFB1), secreted as a homodimer, binds to TGF-beta receptor II (TGFBR2), inducing its dimerization and formation of a stable hetero-tetrameric complex with TGF-beta receptor I homodimer (TGFBR1). TGFBR2-mediated phosphorylation of TGFBR1 triggers internalization of the heterotetrameric TGF beta receptor complex (TGFBR) into clathrin coated endocytic vesicles and recruitment of cytosolic SMAD2 and SMAD3, which act as R-SMADs for TGF beta receptor complex. TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, promoting?their association with SMAD4 (known as Co-SMAD). In the nucleus, the SMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer binds target DNA elements and, in cooperation with other transcription factors, regulates expression of genes involved in cell differentiation. For a review of TGF-beta receptor signaling, please refer to Kang et al. 2009. Signaling by BMP is triggered by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMPs can bind type I receptors in the absence of type II receptors, but the presence of both types dramatically increases binding affinity. The type II receptor kinase transphosphorylates the type I receptor, leading to recruitment and phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8, which function as R-SMADs in BMP signalling pathways. Phosphorylated SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 form heterotrimeric complexes with SMAD4, the only Co-SMAD in mammals. The SMAD1/5/8:SMAD4 heterotrimer regulates transcription of genes involved in development of many tissues, including bone, cartilage, blood vessels, heart, kidney, neurons, liver and lung.

Estrogen receptor palmitoylation is a prerequisite for the E2-dependent activation of extra-nuclear signaling both in vitro and in animal models (Acconcia et al, 2004; Acconcia et al, 2005; Marino et al, 2006; Marino and Ascenzi, 2006). Non-genomic signaling through the estrogen receptor ESR1 also depends on receptor arginine methylation by PMRT1 (Pedram et al, 2007; Pedram et al, 2012; Le Romancer et al, 2008; reviewed in Arnal, 2017; Le Romancer et al, 2011 ). E2-evoked extra-nuclear signaling is independent of the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors and occurs within seconds to minutes following E2 administration to target cells. Extra-nuclear signaling consists of the activation of a plethora of signaling pathways?including the RAF/MAP kinase cascade and the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade and governs processes such as apoptosis, cellular proliferation and metastasis (reviewed in Hammes et al, 2007; Handa et al, 2012; Lange et al, 2007; Losel et al, 2003; Arnal et al, 2017; Le Romancer et al, 2011).

In the nervous system, E2 affects neural functions such as cognition, behaviour, stress responses and reproduction in part by inducing such rapid extra-nuclear responses (Farach-Carson and Davis, 2003; Losel et al, 2003), while in endothelial cells, non-genomic ESR-dependent signaling also regulates vasodilation through the eNOS pathway (reviewed in Levin, 2011). Extra-nuclear signaling additionally cross-talks with nuclear estrogen receptor signaling and is required to control ER protein stability (La Rosa et al, 2012)Recent data have demonstrated that the membrane ESR1 can interact with various endocytic proteins to traffic and signal within the cytoplasm. This receptor intracellular trafficking appears to be dependent on the phyical interaction of ESR1 with specific trans-membrane receptors such as IGR-1R and beta 1-integrin (Sampayo et al, 2018)",NA,

Here, the enzymes UGGG1 or UGGG2 are able to recognize glycoproteins with minor folding process and re-add the glucose on the alpha,1,3 branch; this is a signal for the transport of these glycoproteins back to the ER, where they can interact again with CNX or CRT in order to achieve a correct folding. At the same time that the glycoprotein is in the ERQC, the enzyme ER mannosidase I progressively removes the mannoses at positions 1A, 2A, B, C on N-glycans; when the mannose on 1A is trimmed, UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferases 1 and 2 (UGGT1 and 2) are no longer able to re-add the glucose, and therefore the protein is destined for ERAD. Glycoproteins subject to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) undergo reglucosylation, deglucosylation, and mannose trimming to yield Man6GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2. These structures lack?the mannose residue that is the acceptor of glucose transferred by UGGT1 and 2. For years it has been thought that the removal of the mannose in position B of the N-glycan was the signal to direct proteins to degradation. However, this mechanism has been described better by Avezov et al (Avezov et al. 2008) and it has been demonstrated that even glycoproteins with Man8 or Man7 glycans can be re-glucosylated and interact again with CNX or CRT (for a review on this topic, see Lederkremer 2009 and Maattanen P et al, 2010).",NA,

The activation triggers cleavage of NOTCH3, first by ADAM10 at the S2 cleavage site, then by gamma-secretase at the S3 cleavage site, resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH3, NICD3, into the cytosol. NICD3 subsequently traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. NOTCH3 expression pattern is more restricted than the expression patterns of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, with predominant expression of NOTCH3 in vascular smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes and the nervous system (reviewed by Bellavia et al. 2008). Based on the study of Notch3 knockout mice, Notch3 is not essential for embryonic development or fertility (Krebs et al. 2003).Germline gain-of-function NOTCH3 mutations are an underlying cause of the CADASIL syndrome - cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. CADASIL is characterized?by degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells from the arterial wall, predisposing affected individuals to an early onset stroke (Storkebaum et al. 2011). NOTCH3 promotes survival of vascular smooth muscle cells at least in part by induction of CFLAR (c FLIP), an inhibitor of FASLG activated death receptor signaling. The mechanism of NOTCH3 mediated upregulation of CFLAR is unknown; it is independent of the NOTCH3 coactivator complex and involves an unelucidated crosstalk with the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway (Wang et al. 2002).In rat brain, NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 are expressed at sites of adult neurogenesis, such as the dentate gyrus (Irvin et al. 2001). NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes differentiation of the rat adult hippocampus derived multipotent neuronal progenitors into astroglia (Tanigaki et al. 2001). NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and their ligand DLL1 are expressed in neuroepithelial precursor cells in the neural tube of mouse embryos. Together, they signal to inhibit neuronal differentiation of neuroepithelial precursors. Expression of NOTCH3 in mouse neuroepithelial precursors is stimulated by growth factors BMP2, FGF2, Xenopus TGF beta5 - homologous to TGFB1, LIF, and NTF3 (Faux et al. 2001).In mouse telencephalon, NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes radial glia and neuronal progenitor phenotype. This can, at least in part be attributed to NOTCH mediated activation of RBPJ-dependent and HES5-dependent transcription (Dang et al. 2006).In mouse spinal cord, Notch3 is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. Notch3 knockout mice have a decreased number of mature inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which may be involved in chronic pain conditions (Rusanescu and Mao 2014).NOTCH3 amplification was reported in breast cancer, where NOTCH3 promotes proliferation and survival of ERBB2 negative breast cancer cells (Yamaguchi et al. 2008), and it has also been reported in ovarian cancer (Park et al. 2006). NOTCH3 signaling is involved in TGF beta (TGFB1) signaling-induced eptihelial to mesenchimal transition (EMT) (Ohashi et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2014)NOTCH3 indirectly promotes development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). NOTCH3 signaling activates pre-TCR-dependent and PKC-theta (PRKCQ)-dependent NF-kappaB (NFKB) activation, resulting in induction of FOXP3 expression (Barbarulo et al. 2011). Deregulated NOTCH3 and pre-TCR signaling contributes to development of leukemia and lymphoma (Bellavia et al. 2000, Bellavia et al. 2002).",NA,

RHO GTPases are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes that depend on dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton, including cell migration, cell adhesion, cell division, establishment of cellular polarity and intracellular transport. As a consequence, RHO GTPases play important roles in neuronal development, immunity and cardio-vascular homeostasis. RHO GTPases are involved in the etiology of infectious diseases, congenital immunodeficiencies, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. For review, please refer to Jaffe and Hall 2005, Lemichez and Aktories 2013, Ridley 2015, Hodge and Ridley 2016, Haga and Ridley 2016, Olson 2018, and Kalpachidou et al. 2019.Phylogenetically, RHO GTPases can be grouped into four clusters. The first cluster consists of three subfamilies: Rho, RhoD/RhoF and Rnd. The second cluster consists of three subfamilies: Rac, Cdc42?and RhoU/RhoV. The third cluster consists of the RhoH subfamily. The fourth cluster consists of the RhoBTB subfamily. Miro GTPases and RHOBTB3 ATPase are sometimes described as Rho family members, but they are phylogenetically distant from the Rho family and constitute two separate families of Ras-like GTPases, which, besides Rho, Miro and RHOBTB3 also includes Ran, Arf, Rab and Ras families (Boureux et al. 2007). Based on their activation type, RHO GTPases can be divided into classical (typical) and atypical (reviewed by Haga and Ridley 2016, and Kalpachidou et al. 2019). Classical RHO GTPases cycle between active GTP-bound states and inactive GDP-bound states through steps that are tightly controlled by members of three classes of proteins: (1) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors or GDIs, which maintain Rho proteins in an inactive state in the cytoplasm, (2) guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs, which destabilize the interaction between Rho proteins and their bound nucleotide, the net result of which is the exchange of bound GDP for the more abundant GTP, and (3) GTPase activating proteins or GAPs, which stimulate the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Rho family members, thus promoting their inactivation. GDIs, GEFs, and GAPs are themselves subject to tight regulation, and the overall level of Rho activity reflects the balance of their activities. Many of the Rho-specific GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs act on multiple Rho GTPases, so that regulation of these control proteins can have complex effects on the functions of multiple Rho GTPases (reviewed by Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey 1997, and Hodge and Ridley 2016). The classical Rho GTPase cycle is diagrammed in the figure below. External or internal cues promote the release of Rho GTPases from the GDI inhibitory complexes, which allows them to associate with the plasma membrane, where they are activated by GEFs (1), and can signal to effector proteins (4). Then, GAPs inactivate the GTPases by accelerating the intrinsic GTPase activity, leading to the GDP bound form (2). Once again, the GDI molecules stabilize the inactive GDP bound form in the cytoplasm, waiting for further instructions (3) (Tcherkezian and Lamarche-Vane, 2007). Classical RHO GTPases include four subfamilies: Rho (includes RHOA, RHOB and RHOC), Rac (includes RAC1, RAC2, RAC3 and RHOG), Cdc42 (includes CDC42, RHOJ and RHOQ) and RhoD/RhoF (includes RHOD and RHOF) (reviewed in Haga and Ridley 2016). RHOA, the founding member of the RHO GTPase family, regulates the actin cytoskeleton, formation of stress fibers and cell contractility, which is implicated in cell adhesion and migration (Lessey et al. 2012). RHOB and RHOC functions resemble RHOA (Vega and Ridley 2018; Guan et al. 2018). RHOB is also involved in membrane trafficking and DNA repair (Vega and Ridley 2018). RAC1 regulates the cytoskeleton and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Acevedo and Gonzalez-Billault 2018), and is involved in cell adhesion and cell migration (Marei and Malliri 2017). RAC2 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells and RAC2 is a component of the phagocytic oxidase complex in neutrophils (Troeger and Williams 2013). RAC3 shares 92% sequence identity with RAC1 and is highly expressed in neurons (de Curtis 2019). CDC42 regulate the cytoskeleton and cell polarity, and is involved in cell adhesion and migration as well as in intracellular membrane trafficking (Egorov and Polishchuk 2017; Xiao et al. 2018; Pichaud et al. 2019; Woods and Lew 2019). RHOJ is highly expressed in endothelial cells, regulating their motility and vascular morphogenesis (Leszczynska et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2016). RHOQ (also known as TC10) is highly activated on exocytosing vesicles and recycling endosomes (Donnelly et al. 2014) and is involved in trafficking of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) (Cheng et al. 2005). RHOD regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular transport of vesicles (Randazzo 2003; Gad and Aspenstrom 2010; Aspenstrom et al. 2014, Aspenstrom et al. 2020). RHOF regulates cytoskeletal dynamics (Gad and Aspenstrom 2010; Aspenstrom et al. 2014, Aspenstrom et al. 2020) and promotes the formation of filopodia and stress fibers (Fan and Mellor 2012). RHOD and RHOF do possess GTPase activity and are therefore grouped with classical RHO GTPases, but they are atypical in the sense that they possess high intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity and do not require GEFs for activation (Aspenstrom et al. 2020).Atypical RHO GTPases do not possess GTPase activity. They therefore constitutively exist in the active GTP-bound state. Atypical RHO GTPases include three subfamilies: Rnd (includes RND1, RND2 and RND3), RhoBTB (includes RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2), RhoH (RHOH is the only member) and RhoU/RhoV (includes RHOU and RHOV). RND1 and RND3 can antagonize RHOA activity, leading to loss of stress fibers and cell rounding (Haga and Ridley 2016). RND1, RND2 and RND3 regulate cell migration (Ridley 2015; Mouly et al. 2019). RHOBTB1 is a component of a signaling cascade that regulates vascular function and blood pressure (Ji and Rivero 2016). RHOBTB2 is involved in COP9 signalosome-regulated and CUL3-dependent protein ubiquitination (Berthold et al. 2008; Ji and Rivero 2016). RHOH expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells, and it is known to be involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and T cell development (Suzuki and Oda 2008; Troeger and Williams 2013). RHOU and RHOV expression is induced by WNT signaling and they are involved in regulation of cell shape and cell adhesion (Faure and Fort 2015; and Hodge and Ridley 2016).Almost every classical RHO GTPase interacts with multiple GEFs, GAPs and GDIs, and every RHO GTPase activates multiple downstream effectors. There are 82 Rho GEFs (71 Dbl, reviewed in Fort and Blangy 2017, and 11 DOCK, reviewed in Meller et al. 2005), 66 Rho GAPs (Amin et al. 2016) and 3 Rho GDIs (Dransart et al. 2005) encoded by the human genome. To keep our reaction annotations compact, we have grouped the GEF, GAP, GDI and effector proteins associated with each RHO GTPase into sets. Within a set, we have distinguished full set members from candidate members on the basis of the amount of experimental evidence supporting the member¡¯s molecular function. Note that members of a set can otherwise be functionally quite diverse. Annotation of upstream activators of GEFs, GAPs and GDIs was outside the scope of this catalogue pathway and is or will be shown elsewhere in Reactome.

Posttranslational modifications of the unique C-terminus of RHOB regulate its subcellular localization. Similar to RHOA and RHOC, RHOB regulates the cytoskeleton and plays a role in cell migration. RHOB plays a role in regulation of membrane trafficking (Vega and Ridley 2018), cell proliferation (Vega and Ridley 2018), cell adhesion (Vega and Ridley 2018), DNA repair (Vega and Ridley 2018), and apoptosis (Prendergast 2001; Vega and Ridley 2018).

By regulating the cytoskeleton, CDC42 regulates cell polarity across different species, from yeast to humans (Pichaud et al. 2019, Woods and Lew 2019). CDC42 is an essential regulator of polarized morphogenesis in epithelial cells, where it coordinates formation of the apical membrane and lumen formation, as well as junction maturation (Pichaud et al. 2019). CDC42 plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion and cell cycle regulation (Xiao et al. 2018). CDC42 takes part in the regulation of membrane trafficking. Dysfunction of several CDC42-specific GEFs has been shown to impair intracellular trafficking (Egorov and Polishchuk 2017). CDC42 participates in insulin synthesis and secretion and contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance?and diabetic nephropathy (Huang et al. 2019). CDC42 is often dysregulated in cancer because a number of GEFs and GEF activators that act upstream of RAC1 and CDC42 are known oncogenes (Aguilar et al. 2017; Maldonado et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019; Maldonado et al. 2020).

RAC1 regulates the cytoskeleton and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Acevedo and Gonzalez-Billault 2018) and is involved in cell adhesion and cell migration (Marei and Malliri 2017). RAC1 is involved in neuronal development (de Curtis et al. 2014). In neurons, RAC1 activity is regulated by synaptic activation and RAC1-mediated changes in actin cytoskeleton are implicated in dendritic spine morphogenesis, which plays a role in memory formation and learning (Tajeda-Simon 2015; Costa et al. 2020). RAC1 is involved in metabolic regulation of pancreatic islet Î²-cells and in diabetes pathophysiology (Kowluru 2017; Kowluru et al. 2020). RAC1-mediated activation of NOX2 contributes to mitochondrialÂ damage and the development of retinopathy in patients with diabetes (Sahajpal et al. 2019). RAC1 is important for exercise and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscles (Sylow et al. 2014). RAC1 plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity under physiological conditions and during tissue repair after resolution of colitis. Toxins of many diarrhea-causing bacteria target RAC1 (Kotelevets and Chastre 2020). RAC1 is important for skin homeostasis and wound healing and is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Winge and Marinkovich 2019). RAC1 is essential to vascular homeostasis and chronically elevated RAC1 signaling contributes to vascular pathology (Marinkovic et al. 2015). RAC1 hyperactivation, mutation and copy-number gain are frequently observed in solid tumors (Zou et al. 2017; De et al. 2019; De et al. 2020; Cannon et al. 2020; Kotelevets and Chastre 2020).Â ",NA,

No GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) have been reported to interact with RHOT1. RHOT1 is a mitochondrial RHO GTPase. Like related RHOT2 (MIRO-2), RHOT1 localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane. RHOT1 is implicated in mitochondrial movement inside the cells (Schwarz 2013), including the axonal transport of mitochondria in neurons (Saxton and Hollenbeck 2012; Birsa et al. 2013; Devine et al. 2016), as well as mitochondrial fission and fusion (Saxton and Hollenbeck 2012). RHOT1/RHOT2-mediated mitochondrial turnover is affected in neurodegenerative diseases (Birsa et al. 2013; Devine et al. 2016).

Ligand binding induces a conformational change in NOTCH3, which exposes the S2 site in the extracellular region of NOTCH3. The S2 site is cleaved by ADAM10 metalloprotease, generating the membrane anchored NOTCH3 fragment NEXT3. The NEXT3 fragment of NOTCH3 is further cleaved at the S3 site by the gamma secretase complex, releasing the intracellular domain NICD3 into the cytosol (Groot et al. 2014). Besides DLL/JAG ligands, NOTCH3 signaling can also be activated by binding of NOTCH3 to YBX1 (YB 1) (Rauen et al. 2009). NICD3 traffics to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. WWP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates NOTCH3 signaling by ubiquitinating NEXT3 and NICD3 in the cytosol and targeting them for lysosome-mediated degradation (Jung et al. 2014).

It is believed that auto polyubiquitination and oligomerization of TRAF6 is followed by binding the ubiquitin receptors of TAB2 or TAB3 (TAK1 binding protein 2 and 3), which stimulates phosphorylation and activation of TGF beta-activated kinase 1(TAK1).TAK1 phosphorylates IKK alpha and IKK beta, which in turn phosphorylate NF-kB inhibitors - IkB and eventually results in IkB degradation and NF-kB translocation to the nucleus. Also TAK1 mediates JNK and p38 MAP kinases activation by phosphorylating MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 respectivly resulting in the activation of many transcription factors. The role of TRAF6 is somewhat controversial and probably cell type specific. TRAF6 autoubiquitination was found to be dispensable for TRAF6 function to activate TAK1 pathway. These findings are consistent with the new mechanism of TRAF6-mediated NF-kB activation?that was suggested by Xia et al. (2009). TRAF6 generates unanchored Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains that bind to the regulatory subunits of TAK1 (TAB2 or TAB3) and IKK(NEMO), leading to the activation of the kinases. Xia et al. (2009) demonstrated in vitro that unlike polyubiquitin chains covalently attached to TRAF6 or IRAK, TAB2 and NEMO-associated ubiquitin chains were found to be unanchored and susceptible to N-terminal ubiquitin cleavage. Only K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, but not monomeric ubiquitin, activated TAK1 in a dose-dependent manner. Optimal activation of the IKK complex was achieved using ubiquitin polymers containing both K48 and K63 linkages.Furthermore, the authors proposed that the TAK1 complexes might be brougt in close proximity by binding several TAB2/3 to a single polyubiquitin chain to facilitate TAK1 kinase trans-phosphorylation.

ESR1 and ESR2 share overlapping but distinct functions, with ESR1 playing the primary role in transcriptional activation in most cell types (Hah and Krauss, 2014; Haldos¨¦n et al, 2014. The receptors function as ligand-dependent dimers and can activate target genes either through direct binding to an estrogen responsive element (ERE) in the target gene promoter, or indirectly through interaction with another DNA-binding protein such as RUNX1, SP1, AP1 or NF-kappa beta (reviewed in Bai and Gust, 2009; Hah and Krause, 2014). Binding of estrogen receptors to the DNA promotes the assembly of higher order transcriptional complexes containing methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases and other transcriptional activators, which promote transcription by establishing active chromatin marks and by recruiting general transcription factors and RNA polymerase?II. ESR1- and estrogen-dependent recruitment of up to hundreds of coregulators has been demonstrated by varied co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic approaches (Kittler et al, 2013; Mohammed et al, 2013; Foulds et al, 2013; Mohammed et al, 2015; Liu et al, 2014; reviewed in Magnani and Lupien, 2014; Arnal, 2017). In some circumstances, ligand-bound receptors can also promote the assembly of a repression complex at a target gene, and in some cases, heterodimers of ESR1 and ESR2 serve as repressors of ESR1-mediated target gene activation (reviewed in Hah and Kraus, 2014; Arnal et al, 2017). Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor also modulates its activity, and provides cross-talk between nuclear estrogen-dependent signaling and non-genomic estrogen signaling from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Anbalagan and Rowan, 2015; Halods¨¨n et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2016) A number of recent genome wide studies highlight the breadth of the transcriptional response to estrogen. The number of predicted estrogen-dependent target genes ranges from a couple of hundred (based on microarray studies) to upwards of 10000, based on ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq (Cheung and Kraus, 2010; Kinnis and Kraus, 2008; Lin et al, 2004; Welboren et al, 2009; Ikeda et al, 2015; Lin et al, 2007; Carroll et al, 2006). Many of these predicted sites may not represent transcriptionally productive binding events, however. A study examining ESR1 binding by ChIP-seq in 20 primary breast cancers identified a core of 484 ESR-binding events that were conserved in at least 75% of ER+ tumors, which may represent a more realistic estimate (Ross-Innes et al, 2012). These studies also highlight the long-range effect of estrogen receptor-binding, with distal enhancer or promoter elements regulating the expression of many target genes, often through looping or other higher order chromatin structures (Kittler et al, 2013; reviewed in Dietz and Carroll, 2008; Liu and Cheung, 2014; Magnani and Lupien, 2014). Transcription from a number of estrogen-responsive target genes also appears to be primed by the binding of pioneering transcription factors such as FOXA1, GATA3, PBX1 among others. These factors bind to heterochromatin by virtue of their winged helix domains and promote chromatin opening, allowing subsequent recruitment of other transcription factors (reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011; Fiorito et al, 2013; Arnal et al, 2017; Magnani et al, 2011)",NA,

The condition of acute inflammation is created by the release of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotrienes (LTs) and prostaglandins (PGs) that launch a series of signaling cascades to destroy invading pathogens and to repair damaged tissue (Libby 2007). The potent chemotactic agent leukotriene B4 (LTB4) promotes the recruitment of neutrophils (PMNs) to inflamed tissues, while the prostaglandins E2 and D2 (PGE2 and PGD2) further accelerate the inflammatory process. If left unchecked, the inflammatory response can initiate chronic systemic inflammatory disorders associated with cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, asthma, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Alzheimer¡¯s disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The specific role by which inflammation contributes to their pathogenesis is not fully understood.To prevent the onset of chronic?inflammation, a lipid mediator class switch is thought to occur from the initial actions of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators to the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions of lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins (collectively called specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs)). Nanopicogram quantities of different lipid mediators are generated at different times during the evolution of the inflammatory response and these mediators coincide with distinct cellular events. The class switch activates leukocyte translational regulation of the enzymes required to produce pro-resolving lipid mediators (Levy et al. 2001). Each family of these PSMs exert specialized actions, including blocking neutrophil recruitment, promoting the recruitment and activation of monocytes, as well as mediating the nonphlogistic phagocytosis and lymphatic clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by activated macrophages (ie without inducing inflammation) and mediating tissue regeneration. Eventually, through the combined actions of these mediators, the resolution of inflammation is completed and homeostasis is reached (Serhan 2010, Bannenberg & Serhan 2010, Freire & Van Dyke 2013, Serhan et al. 2014).SPMs are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Molfino et al. 2017). PUFAs of the ¦Ø-3 series are essential nutrients since they cannot be produced by humans (Duvall & Levy 2016) and are primarily found in dietary fish oils (Calder 2013) and in plants (Baker et al. 2016). The ¦Ø-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) circulate in the bloodstream after dietary intake and are easily incorporated into cellular membranes in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Calder 2009), as well as being present in inflammatory exudates (Kasuga et al. 2008). They can be mobilised by phospholipase A2 from cellular membranes on injury or infection when they are converted to exudate SPMs (Serhan et al. 2002) to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). EPA is the source for E-series resolvins while DHA is the source for D-series resolvins, protectins, maresins and sulfido conjugates in tissue regeneration mediators (Serhan et al. 2017). The ¦Ø-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) is the source for lipoxins. ¦Ø-3 or ¦Ø-6 PUFA docosapentaenoic acids (DPAn-3 and DPAn-6) are the sources of DPA-derived resolvins, protectins and maresins (Vik et al. 2017). Aspirin can also trigger the production of epimeric SPMs via acetylated PTGS2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase, COX2) (Serhan & Chiang 2002). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis can generate numerous SPMs. Electrophilic oxo-derivatives of ¦Ø-3 PUFAs are a class of oxidised derivatives that are generated in macrophages and neutrophils by the actions of 5-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2 and acetylated cyclooxygenase-2, followed by dehydrogenation. Being electrophilic, oxo-derivative SPMs reversibly bind to nucleophilic residues on target proteins, triggering the activation of cytoprotective pathways (Cipollina 2015).

MaR1 exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, analgesic and wound healing activities. Major cellular targets for the actions of MaR1 are vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and vascular endothelial cells. In these cells MaR1 attenuates the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium induced by TNF-alpha. Maresin 1 also inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species by both VSM and endothelial cells. The major mechanism through which MaR1 exerts these effects is through down-regulation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF¦ÊB).

This is a single chain type 1 transmembrane protein comprising an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular region called the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain that is structurally conserved and shared by other members of the two families of receptors (Xu et al. 2000). This domain is also shared by the downstream adapter molecule MyD88. IL1 binding to IL1R1 leads to the recruitment of a second receptor chain termed the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP or IL1RAcP) enabling the formation of a high-affinity ligand-receptor complex that is capable of signal transduction. Intracellular signaling is initiated by the recruitment of MyD88 to the IL-1R1/IL1RAP complex. IL1RAP is only recruited to IL1R1 when IL1 is present; it is believed that a TIR domain signaling complex is formed between the receptor and the adapter TIR domains. The recruitment of MyD88 leadsÂ to the recruitment of Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and -4, probably via their death domains. IRAK4 then activates IRAK1, allowing IRAK1 to autophosphorylate. Both IRAK1 and IRAK4 then dissociate from MyD88 (Brikos et al. 2007) which remains stably complexed with IL-1R1 and IL1RAP. They in turn interact with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR)-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Deng et al. 2000). TRAF6 is then thought to auto-ubiquinate, attaching K63-polyubiquitin to itself with the assistance of the E2 conjugating complex Ubc13/Uev1a. K63-pUb-TRAF6 recruits Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) in a complex with TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3, which both contain nuclear zinc finger motifs that interact with K63-polyubiquitin chains (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al. 1999). This activates TAK1, which then activates inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase 2 (IKK2 or IKKB) within the IKK complex, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of IkappaB. The IKK complex also contains the scaffold protein NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO). TAK1 also couples to the upstream kinases for p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). IRAK1 undergoes K63-linked polyubiquination; Pellino E3 ligases are important in this process. (Butler et al. 2007; Ordureau et al. 2008). The activity of these proteins is greatly enhanced by IRAK phosphorylation (Schauvliege et al. 2006), leading to K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1. This recruits NEMO to IRAK1, with NEMO binding to polyubiquitin (Conze et al. 2008).TAK1 activates IKKB (and IKK), resulting in phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkB proteins and enabling translocation of NFkB to the nucleus; IKKB also phosphorylates NFkB p105, leading to its degradation and the subsequent release of active TPL2 that triggers the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 MAPK cascade. TAK1 can also trigger the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways via activating the upstream MKKs3, 4 and 6. The MAPK pathways activate a number of downstream kinases and transcription factors that co-operate with NFkB to induce the expression of a range of TLR/IL-1R-responsive genes. There are reports suggesting that IL1 stimulation increases nuclear localization of IRAK1 (Bol et al. 2000) and that nuclear IRAK1 binds to the promoter of NFkB-regulated gene and IkBa, enhancing binding of the NFkB p65 subunit to NFkB responsive elements within the IkBa promoter. IRAK1 is required for IL1-induced Ser-10 phosphorylation of histone H3 in vivo (Liu et al. 2008). However, details of this aspect of IRAK1 signaling mechanisms remain unclear. Interleukin-18 is another Interleukin-1 related cytokine which signals through IL18R and IL18RAP subunit receptors (which share homology with IL1R and IL1RAP in the cytokine signaling cascade). Later it follows a MYD88/IRAK1/TRAF6 cascade signaling until reach the NFKB activation (Moller et al. 2002). Interleukin 33, 36, 37 and 38 are relatively recently discovered Interleukin-1 related citokines which are also able to signal through IL1 receptor subunits or other as IL18R, IL37R (Schmitz et al. 2005, Yi et al. 2016, Lunding et al. 2015, van de Veendorck et al. 2012, Lin et al. 2001)",NA,

Transcription of miR-132 is regulated by BDNF signaling, through an unknown mechanism (Klein et al. 2007, Su et al. 2015).Binding of MECP2 to other proteins and to DNA is regulated by posttranslational modifications, of which phosphorylation has been best studied. Calcium dependent protein kinases, PKA and CaMK IV, activated by neuronal membrane depolarization, phosphorylate MECP2 at threonine residue T308 (corresponding to T320 in the longer MECP2 splicing isoform, MECP2_e1). Phosphorylation at T308 correlates with neuronal activity and inhibits binding of MECP2 to the nuclear receptor co-repressor complex (NCoR/SMRT) (Ebert et al. 2013). In resting neurons, MECP2 is phosphorylated at?serine residue S80, which results in a decreased association of MECP2 with chromatin. Nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase HIPK2 phosphorylates MECP2 on serine residue S80 (Bracaglia et al. 2009). In activity-induced neurons, upon neuronal membrane depolarization, MECP2 S80 becomes dephosphorylated, and MECP2 acquires phosphorylation on serine S423 (corresponding to mouse Mecp2 serine S421). CaMK IV is one of the kinases that can phosphorylate MECP2 on S423. Phosphorylation of MECP2 at S423 increases MECP2 binding to chromatin (Zhou et al. 2006, Tao et al. 2009, Qiu et al. 2012). AURKB phosphorylates MECP2 at serine residue S423 in dividing adult neuronal progenitor cells (Li et al. 2014).Besides binding to the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex (Lyst et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013), MECP2 binds the SIN3A co-repressor complex. This interaction involves the transcriptional repressor domain of MECP2 and the amino terminal part of the HDAC interaction domain (HID) of SIN3A. HDAC1 and HDAC2 are part of the SIN3A co-repressor complex that co-immunoprecipitates with MECP2 (Nan et al. 1998). While binding of MECP2 to SIN3A at target genes is associated with transcriptional repression, binding to CREB1 at target genes is associated with transcriptional activation (Chahrour et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2013). Function of MECP2 can be affected by binding to FOXG1, another gene mutated in Rett syndrome besides MECP2 and CDKL5 (Dastidar et al. 2012), and HTT (Huntingtin) (McFarland et al. 2013). The subnuclear localization of MECP2 may be affected by binding to the Lamin B receptor (LBR) (Guarda et al. 2009).",NA,

The initial transformation of EPA can be mediated by either cytochrome P450s or aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase-2, resulting in 18(R)- and 18(S)-stereospecific E-resolvins. Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions determine the type of E-resolvin formed (RvE1, RvE2 or RvE3) (Serhan & Petasis 2011). Aspirin acetylation of cyclooxygenase isoforms results in changed activities. Acetylation of cyclooxygenase-1 results in its inhibition and thereby halting production of inflammatory mediators. However, acetylation of cyclooxygenase-2 transforms its enzyme activity from a cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase, thereby blocking prostaglandin biosynthesis and, additionally, initiating the production ofÂ SPMs (Arita et al. 2005, Kyriakopoulos et al. 2017).

The natural ligands of NR1H2 and NR1H3 are oxysterols (e.g., 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (OH), 25-OH, and 27-OH) that are produced endogenously by enzymatic reactions, by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent oxidation of cholesterol and by the alimentary processes (reviewed in:Jakobsson T et al. 2012; Huang C 2014; Komati R et al. 2017). It has been shown that these oxysterols bind directly to the ligand-binding domain of LXRs with Kd values ranging from 0.1 to 0.4?microM. 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol was found to be the most potent endogenous agonist (Janowski BA et al. 1999). NR1H3 (LXR¦Á) and NR1H2 (LXR¦Â) showed similar affinities for these compounds (Janowski BA et al. 1999). In physiological conditions, oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore the LXRs?operate as cholesterol sensors to alter gene expression and protect the cells from cholesterol overload via: (1) inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption; (2) stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins through the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1: (3) activating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver; and (4) activating biliary cholesterol and bile acid excretion (reviewed in: W¨®jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & Ryd¨¦n M 2012; Edwards PA et al. 2002; Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006; Zhao C & Dahlman-Wright K 2010). In addition, LXR agonists enhance de novo fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and hepatic steatosis (W¨®jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & Ryd¨¦n M 2012). In addition to their function in lipid metabolism, NR1H2,3 have also been found to modulate immune and inflammatory responses in macrophages (Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006). The NR1H2 and NR1H3 molecules can be viewed as having four functional domains: (1) an amino-terminal ligand-independent activation function domain (AF-1), which may stimulate transcription in the absence of ligand; (2) a DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing two zinc fingers; (3) a hydrophobic ligand-binding domain (LBD) required for ligand binding and receptor dimerization; and, (4) a carboxy-terminal ligand-dependent transactivation sequence (also referred to as the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain) that stimulates transcription in response to ligand binding (Robinson-Rechavi M et al. 2003; Jakobsson T et al. 2012; F?rnegardh M et al. 2003; Lin CY & Gustafsson JA 2015). Although both NR1H3 and NR1H2 are activated by the same ligands and are structurally similar, their tissue expression profiles are very different. NR1H3 is selectively expressed in specific tissues and cell types, such as the liver, intestine, adrenal gland, adipose tissue and macrophages, whereas NR1H2 is ubiquitously expressed (Nishimura M et al. 2004; Bookout AL et al. 2006). Upon activation NR1H2 or NR1H3 heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and binds to LXR-response elements (LXREs) consisting of a direct repeat of the core sequence 5'-AGGTCA-3' separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4) in the DNA of target genes (Wiebel FF & Gustafsson JA 1997). An inverted repeat of the same consensus sequence with no spacer region(IR-0) and an inverted repeat of the same consensus sequence separated by a 1 bp spacer (IR-1) have also been shown to mediate LXR transactivation (Mak PA et al. 2002, Landrier JF et al. 2003). NR1H3 and NR1H2 have been shown to regulate gene expression via LXREs in the promoter regions of their target genes such as UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A3 (UGT1A3) (Verreault M et al. 2006), fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Joseph SB et al. 2002a), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP, also known as MLX-interacting protein-like or MLXIPL) (Cha JY & Repa JJ 2007) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (Mak PA et al. 2002). LXREs have also been reported to be present in introns of target genes such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) (Sabol SL et al. 2005). NR1H3 has been shown to activate gene expression via the FXR-responsive element found in the proximal promoter of the human ileal bile acid-binding protein (FABP6) (Landrier JF et al. 2003). The NR1H2,3:RXR heterodimers are permissive, in that they can be activated by ligands for either NR1H2,3 (LXR) or RXR (Willy PJ et al. 1995).",NA,

Being electrophilic, these derivatives reversibly bind to nucleophilic residues on target proteins (thiolates of cysteines and amino groups of histidine and lysine), triggering the activation of cytoprotective pathways. These include the Nrf2 antioxidant response, the heat shock response and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ¦Ã (PPAR¦Ã) and suppressing the NF-¦ÊB proinflammatory pathway (Cipollina 2015). Thus, these electrophilic derivatives transduce anti-inflammatory actions rather than suppress the production of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites.

NR1H2 and NR1H3 act as whole-body cholesterol sensors and their activation results in a net elimination of cholesterol from the body and amelioration of the plasma lipoprotein profile by mobilizing cholesterol from the periphery (Venkateswaran A et al. 2000; Repa JJ et al. 2000a; Ishibashi M et al. 2013). NR1H3 (LXRÎ±) and NR1H2 (LXRÎ²) also contribute to lowering of whole-body cholesterol levels by shifting acetyl-CoA units from cholesterol de novo biosynthesis to fatty acid synthesis. NR1H2 or 3-induced hepatic lipogenesis in rodents and humans is mediated by direct upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBF1), the main regulator of hepatic lipogenesis that controls the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (Schultz JR et al. 2000).Â NR1H2 & NR1H3 may activate lipogenic gene transcription directly by biding LXR responsive element (LXRE) found in the promoter regions of several genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS or FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) (Repa JJ et al. 2000b; Yoshikawa T et al. 2001; Joseph SB et al. 2002; Chu K et al. 2006).

During adipocyte lipolysis triglycerides (TGs) are hydrolyzed into free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol by the action of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, encoded by PNPLA2), then hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which is activated by glucagon and adrenaline (epinephrine) and inhibited by insulin. Both isoforms of liver X receptor, LXRÎ± (NR1H3) and LXRÎ² (NR1H2), are expressed in mature mouse and human adipocytes (Juvet LK et al. 2003). Expression of NR1H3 is up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation (Juvet LK et al. 2003; Darimont C et al. 2006). Ligand activation of LXRs (NR1H2 or NR1H3) can induce adipocyte lipolysis and FFA oxidation (Stenson BM et al. 2011; Ross SE et al. 2002).

Another study showed that administration of synthetic ligands of NR1H2/ NR1H3, T0901317 or GW3965, to mice resulted in smaller adipocytes and increased serum free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations, suggesting increased adipocyte lipolysis (Commerford SR et al. 2007). Further, microarray analysis of human adipocytes following NR1H3 or NR1H2 activation revealed altered gene expression of several lipolysis-regulating proteins such as perilipin1 (PLIN1), which was also confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (Stenson BM et al. 2011). Selective knockdown of either NR1H2 or NR1H3 showed that NR1H3 (LXRÎ±) was the major isoform mediating the lipolysis-related effects of LXR agonists (Stenson BM et al. 2011).

NTRK2 promotes CDK5 catalytic activity by phosphorylating CDK5 at tyrosine residue Y15 (Cheung et al. 2007), although CDK5 can also be phosphorylated at Y15 independently of NTRK2 (Zhao et al. 2009). CDK5 phosphorylates serine residue S479 of NTRK2 (corresponds to S478 in mouse and rat) (Cheung et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2009). Phosphorylation of NTRK2 at S479 is needed for BDNF-triggered dendritic growth (Cheung et al. 2007), hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory (Lai et al. 2012).

Landsteiner's discovery of blood groups in 1900 was based on agglutination patterns of red blood cells when blood types from different donors were mixed (Landsteiner 1931, Owen 2000, Tan & Graham 2013). His work is the basis of routine compatibility testing and transfusion practices today. The immune system of patients receiving blood transfusions will attack any donor red blood cells that contain antigens that differ from their self-antigens. Therefore, matching blood types is essential for safe blood transfusions. Landsteiner's classification of the ABO blood groups confirmed that antigens were inherited characteristics. In the 1940s, it was established that the specificity of blood group antigens was determined by their unique oligosaccharide structures. Since then, exponential advances in technology have resulted in the identification of over 300?blood group antigens, classified into more than 35 blood group systems by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) (Storry et al. 2016).Blood group antigens comprise either a protein portion or oligosaccharide sequence attached on a glycolipid or glycoprotein. The addition of one or more specific sugar molecules to this oligosaccharide sequence at specific positions by a variety of glycosyltransferases results in the formation of mature blood group antigens. The genes that code for glycosytransferases can contain genetic changes that produce antigenic differences, resulting in new antigens or loss of expression. Blood group antigens are found on red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, leukocytes, and plasma proteins and also exist in soluble form in bodily secretions such as breast milk, seminal fluid, saliva, sweat, gastric secretions and urine. Blood groups are implicated in many diseases such as those related to malignancy (Rummel & Ellsworth 2016), the cardiovascular system (Liumbruno & Franchini 2013), metabolism (Meo et al. 2016, Ewald & Sumner 2016) and infection (Rios & Bianco 2000, McCullough 2014).

It consists of antigens found on the outer surface of red cells and corresponding antibodies in plasma. The majority of the world's population (~80%) are 'secretors' which means that the antigens present in their blood will also be found in other body fluids such as saliva. An individual can be a Secretor (Se) or a non-secretor (se) and this is completely independent of whether the individual is of blood type A, B, AB, or O. From a very early age, the immune system develops antibodies against whichever ABO blood group antigens are not found on the individual's RBCs. Thus, a blood group A individual will have anti-B antibodies and a blood group B individual will have anti-A antibodies. Individuals with the most common blood group, O, will have both anti-A and anti-B in their plasma. Blood group AB is the least common, and these individuals will have neither anti-A nor anti-B in their plasma.The primary structure?of these antigens is an oligosaccharide precursor sequence on to which one or more sugars are attached at specific locations. The blood group oligosaccharide antigens A, B and H are produced by enzymes expressed by these genes and form the basis of the ABO 'blood type' phenotypes. A and B antigens were originally identified on red blood cells (RBCs) but later identified on other cell types and in bodily secretions. The ABO blood group system is important in blood transfusion, cell/tissue/organ transplantation and forensic evidence at crime scenes.The H antigen is formed with the addition of a fucose sugar onto one of two precursor oligosaccharide sequences (Type 1 chains are Gal ¦Â1,3 GlcNAc ¦Â1,3 Gal R and Type 2 chains are Gal ¦Â1,4 GlcNAc ¦Â1,3 Gal R; where R is a glycoprotein (Type 1) or glycosphingolipid (Type 2). Type 2 chains are only found on RBCs, epithelial cells and endothelial cells. The H gene expressed in hematopoietic cells produces ¦Á-1,2-fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) which adds a fucose to Type 2 chains to form the H antigen in non-secretors. Type 1 chains are found in secretors. The Se gene expressed in secretory glands produces ¦Á-1,2-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) which adds a fucose to Type 1 chains to form the H antigen in secretors.The H antigen is abundant in individuals with blood group O and is the essential precursor for the production of A and B antigens. A and B antigens are formed by the action of glycosyltransferases encoded by functional alleles at the ABO genetic locus. The co dominant A allele encodes A transferase, which transfers an N acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) sugar to the H antigen forming the A antigen. Similarly, the co dominant B allele encodes B transferase, which transfers a galactose (Gal) sugar to the H antigen forming the B antigen. Individuals who have both A and B alleles form the AB antigen. Individuals who are homozygous for the recessive O allele express the H antigen but do not form A or B antigens as they lack both the glycosyltransferase enzymes for their formation. Mutant alleles of the corresponding FUT1 or FUT2 genes result in either a H¨C phenotype (Bombay phenotype, Oh) or a weak H phenotype (para Bombay) where the affected individual cannot form H, A or B antigens (Kaneko et al. 1997, Koda et al. 1997). The biosyntheses of the A, B and H antigens are described in this section (Ewald & Sumner 2016, Scharberg et al. 2016).",NA,

Both genes are expressed in glandular epithelia and have dominant alleles (Le and Se, respectively) coding for enzymes with fucosyltransferase activity and recessive alleles (le and se, respectively) that are non-functional. There are two main Lewis antigens, Lewis A and Lewis B which can result in three common phenotypes: Le(A+B-), Le(A-B+) and Le(A-B-). Lewis antigens are components of exocrine epithelial secretions, and can be adsorbed onto the surfaces of red blood cells (RBCs), therefore are not produced directly by RBCs themselves (Ewald & Sumner 2016).The same two oligosaccharides (Type 1 and Type 2) used to determine ABO blood types are also utilised by the Lewis system. Fucosyltransferase 3 (FUT3, Le) adds fucose to Type 1 chains to form the Lewis A antigen (LeA). IF the individual is a non-secretor (lacks the Se?gene, homozygous sese), LeA is adsorbed onto the red cell, and that individual is LeA type. Approximately 80% of the population has the Se gene. Functional fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2, Se) adds a fucose to LeA to form LeB. Both LeA and LeB present in the plasma of secretors but LeA preferentially adsorbs onto the RBC and therefore, the individual types as LeB. Other FUTs, especially FUT4, can add a fucose to Type 2 chains to form the Lewis X antigen (LeX). Further fucosylation of LeX by FUT2 produces the Lewis Y antigen (LeY). LeX and LeY are structural isomers of LeA and LeB. The formation of LeY is controlled by Se/se as in the case for LeB. LeA and LeX antigens can also undergo sialation to produce sialated forms of these antigens.Aberrant glycosylation of tumour cells is recognised as a feature of cancer pathogenesis. Overexpression of fucosylated and sialated Lewis antigens frequently occurs on the surfaces of cancer cells and is mainly attributed to upregulated expression of the relevant fucosyltransferases (FUTs). The sialyl-Lewis A antigen (sLeA), also known as the CA19-9 antigen, is the most common tumour marker used primarily in the management of pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancers worldwide (Magnani 2004, Blanas et al. 2018).Selectins (L-, E- and P-selectin) are type I membrane proteins composed of long N-terminus C-type lectin domains protruding into the extracellular space and with a short cytoplasmic tail. They bind carbohydrate structures through a Ca2+-dependent domain, the minimal sugar structure recognised fulfilled by sLeA and sLeX. Selectins are found on endothelial cells, platelets and leukocytes and are involved in trafficking of cells of the innate immune system, T lymphocytes and platelets, thereby playing important roles in chronic and acute inflammation and haemostasis. Selectins also play a role in cancer progression. Metastasis is facilitated by cell-cell interactions between cancer cells and endothelial cells in distant tissues. In addition, cancer cell interactions with platelets and leukocytes contribute to cancer cell adhesion, extravasation, and the establishment of metastatic lesions. Targeting selectins and their ligands as well as the enzymes involved in their generation, in particular sialyl transferases, could be a useful strategy in cancer treatment (Ley 2003, Laubli & Borsig 2010, Cheung et al. 2011, Natoli et al. 2016, Trinchera et al. 2017)",NA,

There are two forms of recombination: non-crossover (NCO) and crossover (CO). In mammals, the former is required for correct pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, while CO intermediates called chiasmata are required for correct segregation of bivalents.Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks created by SPO11, which remains covalently attached to the 5' ends after cleavage. SPO11 is removed by cleavage of single DNA strands adjacent to the covalent linkage. The resulting 5' ends are further resected to produce protruding 3' ends. The single-stranded 3' ends are bound by RAD51 and DMC1, homologs of RecA that catalyze a search for homology between the bound single strand and duplex DNA of the chromosomal homolog. RAD51 and DMC1 then catalyze the invasion of the single strand into the homologous duplex and the formation of a D-loop heteroduplex. Approximately 90% of heteroduplexes are resolved without crossovers (NCO), probably by synthesis-dependent strand annealing.The invasive strand is extended along the homolog and ligated back to its original duplex, creating a double Holliday junction. The mismatch repair proteins MSH4, MSH5 participate in this process, possibly by stabilizing the duplexes. The mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3 are then recruited to the double Holliday structure and an unidentified resolvase (Mus81? Gen1?) cleaves the junctions to yield a crossover. Crossovers are not randomly distributed: The histone methyltransferase PRDM9 recruits the recombination machinery to genetically determined hotspots in the genome and each incipient crossover somehow inhibits formation of crossovers nearby, a phenomenon called crossover interference. Each chromosome bivalent, including the X-Y body in males, has at least one crossover and this is required for meiosis to proceed correctly.",NA,

Type III interferon lambda has three members: lamda1 (IL-29), lambda2 (IL-28A), and lambda3 (IL-28B) respectively. IFN-lambda signaling is initiated through unique heterodimeric receptor composed of IFN-LR1/IF-28Ralpha and IL10R2 chains.

Some receptors are continuously internalized into recycling endosomes and returned to the cell surface. Others are sorted into intralumenal vesicles of morphologically distinctive endosomes that are known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These MVBs fuse with lysosomes, resulting in degradation of their cargo by lysosomal acidic hydrolases. Endosomes can be operationally defined as being either early or late, referring to the relative time it takes for endocytosed material to reach either stage. Ultrastructural studies indicate that early endosomes are predominantly tubulovesicular structures, which constitute a major sorting platform in the cell, whereas late endosomes show the characteristics of typical MVBs and are capable of fusing with lysosomes. A well characterized signal for shunting membrane proteins into the degradative MVB pathway is the ubiquitylation of these cargoes. At the center of a vast protein:protein and protein:lipid interaction network that underpins ubiquitin mediated sorting to the lysosome are the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs), which are conserved throughout all major eukaryotic taxa.",NA,

In mammalian cells a termination codon can be recognized as premature if it precedes an exon-exon junction by at least 50-55 nucleotides or if it is followed by an abnormal 3' untranslated region (UTR). While length of the UTR may play a part, the qualifications for being ""abnormal"" have not been fully elucidated. Also, some termination codons preceding exon junctions are not degraded by NMD so the criteria for triggering NMD are not yet fully known (reviewed in Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009). While about 30% of disease-associated mutations in humans activate NMD, about 10% of normal human transcripts are also degraded by NMD (reviewed?in Stalder and Muhlemann 2008, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010, Nicholson et al. 2010). Thus NMD is a normal physiological process controlling mRNA stability in unmutated cells.Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited on an mRNA during splicing in the nucleus and are displaced by ribosomes during the first round of translation. When a ribosome terminates translation the A site encounters the termination codon and the eRF1 factor enters the empty A site and recruits eRF3. Normally, eRF1 cleaves the translated polypeptide from the tRNA in the P site and eRF3 interacts with Polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP) bound to the polyadenylated tail of the mRNA.During activation of NMD eRF3 interacts with UPF1 which is contained in a complex with SMG1, SMG8, and SMG9. NMD can arbitrarily be divided into EJC-enhanced and EJC-independent pathways. In EJC-enhanced NMD, an exon junction is located downstream of the PTC and the EJC remains on the mRNA after termination of the pioneer round of translation. The core EJC is associated with UPF2 and UPF3, which interact with UPF1 and stimulate NMD. Once bound near the PTC, UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG1. The phosphorylation is the rate-limiting step in NMD and causes UPF1 to recruit either SMG6, which is an endoribonuclease, or SMG5 and SMG7, which recruit ribonucleases. SMG6 and SMG5:SMG7 recruit phosphatase PP2A to dephosphorylate UPF1 and allow further rounds of degradation. How EJC-independent NMD is activated remains enigmatic but may involve competition between PABP and UPF1 for eRF3.",NA,

However, in double-deficient mouse fibroblasts, the activation of IRF3 is completely abolished, suggesting a partially redundant functions of TBK1 and IKK-i (Hemmi et al. 2004).TLR3 recruits and activates PI3 kinase (PI3K), which activates the downstream kinase, Akt, leading to full phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 [Sarkar SN et al 2004].

It has been shown that a kinase-dead IRAK1 mutants can still activate NF-kappa-B. Furthermore, stimulation of IRAK1-deficient I1A 293 cells with LMP1 (latent membrane protein 1- a known viral activator of NF-kappa-B) leads to TRAF6 polyubiquitination and IKKbeta activation [Song et al 2006]. On the other hand, IRAK1 enhances p65 Ser536 phosphorylation [Song et al 2006] and p65 binding to the promoter of NF-kappa-B dependent target genes [Liu G et al 2008]. IRAK1 has also been shown to be itself Lys63-polyubiquitinated (probably by Pellino proteins, which have E3 ligase activity). Mutation of the ubiquitination sites on IRAK1 prevented interaction with the NEMO subunit of IKK complex and subsequent IL-1/TLR-induced NF-kappa-B activation [Conze et al 2008]. These data suggest that kinase activity of IRAK1 is not essential for its ability to activate NF-kappa-B, while its Lys63-polyubuquitination?allows IRAK1 to bind NEMO thus facilitating association of TRAF6 and TAK1 complex with IKK complex followed by induction of NF-kappa-B.

IRAK-2 loss-of-function mutants, with mutated TRAF6-binding motifs, could no longer activate NF-kB and could no longer stimulate TRAF-6 ubiquitination (Keating SE et al 2007). Furthermore, the proxyvirus protein A52 - an inhibitor of all IL-1R/TLR pathways to NF-kB activation, was found to interact with both IRAK-2 and TRAF6, but not IRAK-1. Further work showed that A52 inhibits IRAK-2 functions, whereas association with TRAF6 results in A52-induced MAPK activation. The strong inhibition effect of A52 was also observed on the TLR3-NFkB axis and this observation led to the discovery that IRAK-2 is recruited to TLR3 to activate NF-kB (Keating SE et al 2007). Thus, A52 possibly inhibits MyD88-independent TLR3 pathways to NF-kB via targeting IRAK-2 as it does?for other IL-1R/TLR pathways, although it remains unclear how IRAK-2 is involved in TLR3 signaling.IRAK-2 was shown to have two TRAF6 binding motifs that are responsible for initiating TRAF6 signaling transduction (Ye H et al 2002).",NA,

It is believed that auto polyubiquitination and oligomerization of TRAF6 is followed by binding the ubiquitin receptors of TAB2 or TAB3 (TAK1 binding protein 2 and 3), which stimulates phosphorylation and activation of TGF beta-activated kinase 1(TAK1).TAK1 phosphorylates IKK alpha and IKK beta, which in turn phosphorylate NF-kB inhibitors - IkB and eventually results in IkB degradation and NF-kB translocation to the nucleus. Also TAK1 mediates JNK and p38 MAP kinases activation by phosphorylating MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 respectivly resulting in the activation of many transcription factors. The role of TRAF6 is somewhat controversial and probably cell type specific. TRAF6 autoubiquitination was found to be dispensable for TRAF6 function to activate TAK1 pathway. These findings are consistent with the new mechanism of TRAF6-mediated NF-kB activationÂ that was suggested by Xia et al. (2009). TRAF6 generates unanchored Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains that bind to the regulatory subunits of TAK1 (TAB2 or TAB3) and IKK(NEMO), leading to the activation of the kinases. Xia et al. (2009) demonstrated in vitro that unlike polyubiquitin chains covalently attached to TRAF6 or IRAK, TAB2 and NEMO-associated ubiquitin chains were found to be unanchored and susceptible to N-terminal ubiquitin cleavage. Only K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, but not monomeric ubiquitin, activated TAK1 in a dose-dependent manner. Optimal activation of the IKK complex was achieved using ubiquitin polymers containing both K48 and K63 linkages.Furthermore, the authors proposed that the TAK1 complexes might be brougt in close proximity by binding several TAB2/3 to a single polyubiquitin chain to facilitate TAK1 kinase trans-phosphorylation. Alternativly, the possibility that polyUb binding promotes allosteric activation of TAK1 complex should be considered (Walsh et al 2008).",NA,

During telophase, the elevated RAN:GTP near chromatin releases nucleoporins from complexes with nuclear transport receptors, including KPNB1/KPNA (importin alpha/beta) and TPNO1 (transportin), thereby liberating the nucleoporins for NPC assembly (reviewed?by Forbes et al. 2015).",NA,

Recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is intricate and incompletely understood. At the center of the system is a complex of two small GTPases, the Rag heterodimer (RRAGA or RRAGB bound to RRAGC or RRAGD). The Rag heterodimer is tethered to the membrane by the Ragulator complex, which also binds the v-ATPase complex. The Rag heterodimer acts as a cross-regulating switch, with the binding of GTP by one subunit inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP by the other subunit (Shen et al. 2017). The active conformation?of the Rag heterodimer that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP while the inactive conformation, RRAGA,B:GDP:RRAGC,D:GTP, releases mTORC1 (Sancak et al. 2008, Kim et al. 2008, Sancak et al. 2010, Lawrence et al. 2018). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanyl nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) acting upon the Rag heterodimer thereby regulate recruitment of mTORC1. RHEB:GTP at the lysosomal membrane also binds mTORC1 and directly activates mTORC1. During inactivation of mTORC1 in response to removal of amino acids, the TSC complex, a GAP for RHEB, is required in addition to the inactive Rag complex to release mTORC1 from RHEB and hence fully release mTORC1 from the lysosomal membrane (Demetriades et al. 2014).Amino acids regulate recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane by at least 4 mechanisms (reviewed in Zhuang et al. 2019, Wolfson and Sabatini 2017, Yao et al. 2017). 1) Sestrin1 (SESN1) or Sestrin2 (SESN2) binds leucine and the Sestrin1,2:leucine complex is then released from the GATOR2 complex, allowing GATOR2 to positively regulate mTORC1 activation (Chantranupong et al. 2014, Parmigiani et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2015, Wolfson et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016). 2) CASTOR1 in a homodimer or a heterodimer with CASTOR2 binds arginine and the CASTOR1:arginine complex is likewise released from GATOR2, allowing GATOR2 to activate mTORC1 (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016). 3) BMT2 (SAMTOR), a negative regulator of mTORC1 activation, binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a derivative of methionine (Gu et al. 2017). The binding of SAM causes BMT2 to dissociate from GATOR1, allowing the activation of mTORC1. 4) The amino acid transporter SLC38A9 binds arginine and SLC38A9 then acts as a GEF to convert RRAGA,B:GDP to the active form, RRAGA,B:GTP (Rebsamen et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2015, Wyant et al. 2017, Shen and Sabatini 2018). Amino acid starvation also regulates the assembly of the V0 and V1 subunits of v-ATPase by an uncharacterized mechanism (Stransky and Forgac 2015) and v-ATPase is required for activation of mTORC1 by amino acids (Zoncu et al. 2011).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a well-known PAMP produced by gram-negative bacteria. LPS is recognized by toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and is a strong activator of NF-¦ÊB inflammatory responses (Akashi S et al. 2003). LPS is also recognized in the cytosol by mouse caspase-11 and related human caspase-4 and caspase-5, which stimulate pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death (Kayagaki N et al. 2011; Shi J et al. 2015). Key metabolic intermediates in LPS biosynthesis, d-glycero-¦Â-d-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP) and ADP L-glycero-¦Â-d-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose) were reported to activate the NF-¦ÊB pathway and trigger the innate immune responses (Milivojevic M et al. 2017; Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018; Garc¨ªa-Weber D; 2018). ADP-heptose but not HBP can enter host cells autonomously (Zhou?P et al. 2018). During infection, ADP-heptose or HBP translocate into the host cytosol where their presence is sensed by alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1) (Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). ADP-heptose directly binds and activates ALPK1 (Garcia-Weber D et al. 2018; Zhou P et al. 2018); instead, HBP is converted by host-derived adenylyltransferases, such as nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferases, to ADP-heptose 7-P, a substrate which can then activate ALPK1 (Zhou P et al. 2018). The ADP-heptose binding to ALPK1 is thought to trigger conformational changes and stimulate the kinase domain of ALPK1 (Zhou P et al. 2018). ALPK1 kinase activity in turn leads to the phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-¦Á) receptor¨Cassociated factor (TRAF)¨Cinteracting protein with the forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) (Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018).

This TIFA oligomer signaling platform was given the term: TIFAsome. TIFAsome-activated TAK1 induces NF-¦ÊB nuclear translocation and proinflammatory gene expression. The ALPK1-TIFA signaling pathway has been identified in human embryonic kidney cells, intestinal epithelial cells, gastric cells and cervical cancer cells (Gaudet RG et al. 2015, 2017; Stein SC et al. 2017; Gall A et al. 2017; Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Milivojevic M et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). In vivo studies demonstrate that ADP-heptose and Burkholderia cenocepacia trigger massive inflammatory responses with increased production of several NF-¦ÊB-dependent cytokines and chemokines in wild type (WT), but not in Alpk1-/- mice (Zhou P et al. 2018).This Reactome module describes ALPK1 as a cytosolic innate immune receptor for bacterial ADP-heptose.",NA,

Moreover, Glycoproteins that have not entered in the Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle or that have not had their glucose residues trimmed earlier in the ER, can enter the main pathway here due to the existence to an alternative route catalyzed by the enzyme Endomannosidase I (Schachter,?2000; Stanley et al, 2009)",NA,

EML4 is a WD40 family protein that binds to interphase microtubules and stabilizes them (Houtman et al. 2007, Adib et al. 2019). At mitotic entry, EML4 undergoes phosphorylation (Pollmann et al. 2006, Adib et al. 2019) by serine/threonine kinases NEK6 and NEK7, leading to its dissociation from microtubules, which is necessary for the assembly of a dynamic mitotic spindle (Adib et al. 2019). EML4, through its WD40 repeats, interacts with NUDC and recruits it to the kinetochores of the mitotic spindle (Chen et al. 2015). It is possible that other mitotic kinases, besides NEK6 and NEK7, also phosphorylate EML4. Phosphorylation of different residues of EML4 could reduce or increase affinity of EML4 for specific subpopulations of microtubules in mitosis.A recurrent genomic rearrangement, reported in about 5% cases?of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) fuses the N-terminal portion of EML4 with the C-terminal portion of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), resulting in a constitutively active ALK (Soda et al. 2007, Richards et al. 2015).",NA,

The kinases comprise PERK (also called EIF2AK3), which responds to unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum; EIF2AK2 (also called PKR), which responds to cytosolic double-stranded RNA; EIF2AK4 (also called GCN2), which responds to amino acid deficiency; and EIF2AK1 (also called heme-regulated inhibitor, HRI, and heme-controlled repressor, HCR), which responds to heme deficiency and cytosolic unfolded protein. Each molecule of EIF2AK1 binds two molecules of heme, one bound near the N-terminus and one bound at the kinase insert (KI) domain that inhibits the kinase activity of EIF2AK1 (inferred from the rabbit homolog in Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred from the mouse homolog in Misanova et al. 2006, Hirai et al. 2007, Igarashi et al. 2008). Dissociation of heme from the KI domain activates the kinase activity of EIF2AK1, which autophosphorylates (inferred?from the mouse homolog in Bauer et al. 2001, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2003, Igarashi et al. 2011) and then phosphorylates EIF2S1 (Bhavnani et al. 2018, inferred from the rabbit homologs in Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred from the mouse homologs in Lu et al. 2001, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2003, Igarashi et al. 2011).Phosphorylated EIFS1 causes a reduction in general cellular translation and thereby coordinates globin synthesis with heme availability during erythropoiesis (inferred from mouse knockout in Han et al. 2001, reviewed in Chen et al. 2014). Translation of mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomal proteins is most severely reduced, causing a decrease in cellular protein synthesis (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019). Lack of EIF2AK1 causes accumulation of unfolded globins devoid of heme and consequent anemia in iron-deficient mice (inferred from mouse knockout in Han et al. 2001). Activation of the cytoplasmic unfolded protein response and impaired mitochondrial respiration are also observed in HRI deficiency (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019).Phosphorylation of EIFS1 activates translation of certain mRNAs such as ATF4, ATF5, and DDIT3 (CHOP) that have upstream ORFs (inferred from mouse homologs in Harding et al. 2000). ATF4 in turn activates programs of gene expression that ameliorate effects of the stress to maintain mitochondrial function, redox homeostasis, and erythroid differentiation (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019). Unresolved stress, however, can eventually lead to apoptosis regulated by DDIT3. EIF2AK1 also represses mTORC1 (mechanistic target of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling via ATF4-mediated induction of GRB10 as a feedback mechanism to attenuate erythropoietin-mTORC1-stimulated ineffective erythropoiesis in iron deficiency anemia (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2018 and Zhang et. al. 2019).EIF2AK1 is also activated by heat shock, arsenite (oxidative stress), and osmotic stress (inferred from mouse homologs in Lu et al. 2001). The mechanisms by which these stresses act on EIF2AK1 are independent of heme but are not yet fully elucidated. Furthermore, EIF2AK1 is involved in the production of human fetal hemoglobin, and EIF2AK1-mediated stress response has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies (reviewed in Chen and Zhang 2019).In addition to regulation of erythropoiesis, EIF2AK1 shows effects outside of the erythroid lineage, including requirement for the maturation and functions of macrophages (inferred from mouse homologs in Liu et al. 2007), reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes, activation of hepatic expression of fibroblast growth factor, and mediation of translation of GRIN2B (GluN2B. a subunit of the NMDA receptor) and BACE1 in the nervous system (reviewed in Burwick and Aktas 2017).

Leishmania parasites alternate between two distinct developmental stages: the insect-adapted, flagellated, extracellular ¡°promastigote¡± and the mammal-adapted, non flagellated, intracellular ¡°amastigote¡± form, where the later resides within phagolysosomal vesicles of the phagocytic cell (Liu et al. 2012a). Paradoxically, the macrophage, which is the main host cell where the parasite replicates and grows, is at the same time the main cell responsible for its elimination.The uptake of Leishmania promastigotes by host cells is a receptor mediated process that initiates phagocytosis (Ueno et al. 2012). Some parasites differentiate and survive within the macrophage phagolysosomes; others are killed by the acidic and higher temperature environment (Rossi et al. 2018).

Low frequency sounds are sensed at the distal end (apex) of the cochlea; high frequency sounds are sensed at the proximal end (base) of the cochlea (reviewed in Dallos 1992, Manley 2018). Sound vibrations are transmitted from the eardrum through the three bones of the inner ear (malleus, incus, stapes) and the oval window of the cochlea to the fluids within the cochlea. Within the organ of Corti in the cochlea there are 3 rows of outer hair cells (OHCs) on the external side of the tunnel of Corti and 1 row of inner hair cells (IHCs) on the internal side (Spoendlin 1967). Each IHC synapses with approximately 20 afferent myelinated type I spiral ganglion neurons and functions as a sensory receptor to convert the energy of sound waves to secretion of glutamate neurotransmitter. Multiple OHCs synapse with each unmyelinated type II afferent?neuron and OHCs are also synapsed with efferent medial olivocochlear fibers (Spoendlin 1967). The primary function of OHCs, however, is amplification of organ of Corti motions in response to sound (Ryan and Dallos 1975). Amplification is produced by changes in receptor-potential driven cell length caused by changes in the conformation of the unusual membrane protein prestin (SLC26A5, Zheng et al. 2000).IHCs and OHCs sense the sonic vibrations by deflection of stereocilia on their apical surfaces (reviewed in Fettiplace et al. 2017, McPherson 2018). The stereocilia are arranged in rows of increasing height, with a stereocilium of one row connected to a stereocilium of another row by a tip link composed of a CDH23 dimer on the taller stereocilium joined at its N-termini to the N-termini of a PCDH15 dimer on the shorter stereocilium. CDH23 is connected to the cytoskeleton of the taller stereocilium via MYO7A (MyoVIIa), USH1C (Harmonin), and USH1G (Sans) (reviewed in Peng et al. 2011, Cosgrove and Zallocchi 2014, Barr-Gillespie 2015, Fettiplace 2017, McGrath et al. 2017, Cunningham and M¨¹ller 2019, ? Maoil¨¦idigh and Ricci 2019, Velez-Ortega and Frolenkov 2019) while PCDH15 on the shorter stereocilium interacts with LHFPL5, an auxiliary subunit of the mechanoelectrical transduction channel (MET channel, also known as the mechanotransduction channel), which contains at least TMC1 or TMC2, TMIE, and the auxiliary subunits LHFPL5 and CIB2 (reviewed in Fettiplace 2016, Qiu and M¨¹ller 2018, Corey et al. 2019). Deflection of stereocilia in the direction that increases tension on the tip link causes depolarization of the cell by increasing the open probability of the MET channel, which then transports calcium and potassium into the hair cell according to the gradient of those ions between the scala media (containing endolymph at 154 mM K+ and <1 mM Ca2+) at the apex of the cell and the scala tympani (containing perilymph at 7 mM K+) at the base (reviewed in Fettiplace and Kim 2014). Similarly, compression of the tip link by deflection of the stereocilia in the opposite direction decreases the open probability of the MET channel and causes hyperpolarization of the cell.Depolarization of IHCs causes opening of voltage-gated calcium channels arrayed in stripes on the basolateral membrane close to ribbon synapses formed between the IHC and the afferent fiber of a myelinated type I spiral ganglion neuron. This results in a localized increase in cytosolic calcium ions which interact with Otoferlin (OTOF) on glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles at the ribbon structure to activate exocytosis of glutamate into the synapse formed with the afferent neuron (reviewed in Wichmann 2015, Pangrsic and Vogl 2018). Ribbon synapses are distinguished by electron-dense ribbon structures projecting from the presynaptic membrane into the cytosol and comprising at least BASSOON, RIBEYE (an isoform of CTBP2), and PICCOLINO (an isoform of PICCOLO). The ribbon structures appear to transiently bind synaptic vesicles and facilitate resupply of synaptic vesicles at active zones to refill the pool of readily releasable vesicles (reviewed in Moser et al. 2006, Moser et al. 2020).In contrast with IHCs, OHCs mainly function in sound amplification by decreasing up to about 4% in length in response to depolarization caused by opening of the MET channel and increasing in length in response to hyperpolarization caused by channel closing, resulting in alternating compression and decompression between the reticular lamina and the basilar membrane. The changes in the length of the OHC are caused by very rapid (microseconds), voltage-sensitive changes in the conformation of the membrane protein prestin (SLC26A5). Stereociliary ATP2B2 (PMCA2) extrudes calcium ions and basally located KCNQ4 extrudes potassium ions to repolarize the OHC.OHCs are synapsed with efferent cholinergic medial olivocochlear fibers (reviewed in Fritzsch and Elliott 2017, Fuchs and Lauer 2019). Acetylcholine released at the synapse binds an unusual, nicotine-antagonized, nicotinic receptor comprising CHRNA9 and CHRNA10. Upon binding acetylcholine, CHRNA9:CHRNA10 transports calcium ions into the OHC. The calcium activates SK2 potassium channels (KCNN2) and BK potassium channels (KCNMA1:KCNMB1) which extrude potassium ions, hyperpolarize the OHC, and inhibit activation of the OHC. Loud sounds can cause a temporary threshold shift (temporary loss of hearing) caused by damage to stereocilia and synapses or permanent threshold shift (permanent loss of hearing) caused by damage or death of hair cells and neurons (reviewed in Kurabi et al. 2017).",NA,

The liberation of ATP comes from tissues facing stressful stimuli such as a tissue injury or microorganism infection, amongst others.

The intracellular region has a juxtamembrane domain that plays a role in autoinhibiting the receptor in the absence of ligand, and a bi-lobed kinase region with an activation loop and the catalytic cleft (reviewed in Klug et al, 2018). Upon ligand binding, PDGFRA undergoes dimerization and transautophosphorylation at at least 11 tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain.

CSF3 circulates extracellularly as a dimer and binds to the monomeric receptor CSF3R (GCSFR) on neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils (reviewed in Futosi et al. 2013). CSF3R possesses no catalytic activity of its own and is constitutively associated with the kinases LYN (Corey et al. 1994) and JAK1 (Nicholson et al. 1994). Upon binding the CSF3 dimer, CSF3R dimerizes, is phosphorylated, and activates JAK-STAT signaling, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling, and PI3K signaling (reviewed in Basu et al. 2002, Roberts et al. 2005, Kendricks and Bogoyevitch 2007, Touw and van de Geijn 2007).After dimerization of CSF3R, JAK1 associated with CSF3R is required for phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytosolic domain of CSF3R which recruit further kinases such as JAK2, SYK, HCK, and TYK2 (reviewed in Sampson et al. 2007). Phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK2 then appear to?act redundantly to phosphorylate STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5) which dimerize and transit to the nucleus to activate gene expression.CSF3 signaling also activates the RAS pathway, resulting in activation of ERK1 and ERK2 and cellular proliferation. Phosphorylated CSF3R recruits both GRB2, which can act as a scaffold for RAS guanyl exchange factors SOS and VAV, and PTPN11 (SHP2), which activates RAS by dephosphorylating tyrosine-32 of RAS (Bunda et al. 2015). Association of SOS or VAV with the phosphorylated CSF3R has not yet been shown. The pathway to activation of PI3K is uncertain but appears to proceed via GAB2 bound to CSF3R.Mutations in CSF3R can occur during the course of Kostmann disease, a severe congenital neutropenia (reviewed in Zeidler and Welte 2002, Zeidler 2005, Ward 2007, Vandenberghe and Beel 2011). Somatic mutations in CSF3R, principally truncations of the C-terminal region, are involved in the pathogenesis of severe congenital neutropenia and are associated with progression to acute myeloid leukemia (Dong et al. 1995, reviewed in Ward 2007, Beekman and Touw 2010, Xing and Zhao 2016). Loss or mutation of the C-terminal region of CSF3R interferes with inhibition and turnover of the receptor. Mutation of Thr-618 to Ile-618 in CSF3R causes spontaneous dimerization and consequent autoactivation leading to CSF3-independent signaling and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (Maxson et al. 2013).",NA,

The SARS-CoV-1 viral infection pathway here uses entries listed in the UniProt ""Human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus)"" taxonomy.SARS-CoV-1 infection begins with the binding of viral S (spike) protein to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and endocytosis of the bound virion. Within the endocytic vesicle, host proteases mediate cleavage of S protein into S1 and S2 fragments, leading to S2-mediated fusion of the viral and host endosome membranes and release of the viral capsid into the host cell cytosol. The capsid is uncoated to free the viral genomic RNA, whose cap-dependent?translation produces polyprotein pp1a and, by means of a 1-base frameshift, polyprotein pp1ab. Autoproteolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab generates 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) with various functions. Importantly, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity is encoded in nsp12. Nsp3, 4, and 6 induce rearrangement of the cellular endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form cytosolic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) where the viral replication transcription complex is assembled and anchored. With viral genomic RNA as a template, viral replicase-transcriptase synthesizes a full length negative sense antigenome, which in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of new genomic RNA. The replicase-transcriptase can also switch template during discontinuous transcription of the genome at transcription regulated sequences to produce a nested set of negative-sense subgenomic (sg) RNAs, which are used as templates for the synthesis of positive-sense sgRNAs that are translated to generate viral proteins.

Specific interaction between S1 and the cognate receptor triggers a drastic conformational change in S2, leading to fusion between the virus envelope and the cellular membrane and release of the viral nucleocapsid into the host cell cytosol. Receptor binding is the major determinant of the host range and tissue tropism for a coronavirus. Some human coronaviruses (HCoVs ) have adopted cell surface enzymes as receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV NL63. The receptor-bound S protein is activated by cleavage into S1 and S2, mediated by one of two of two host proteases, the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L and another trypsin like serine protease. Type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D have also?been implicated in the activation of S protein of SARS-CoV-1. Host factors may play additional roles in viral entry (not annotated here). Valosin containing protein (VCP) contributes by a poorly understood mechanism to the release of coronavirus from early endosomes. Host factors may also restrict the attachment and entry of HCoV.

Rarely, A and B lineage beta coronaviruses of non-human origin can infect people and then spread directly between people. Four human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults, typically presenting as common colds (van der Hoek 2007).

All of these people had traveled to other parts of the world where the disease was spreading. Community spread was not observed in the United States (De Wit et al. 2016; WHO - SARS).

Although genome replication/transcription is mainly mediated by the viral replicase and confines in the replication-transcription complex (RTC), the involvement of various additional viral and host factors has been implicated. For instance, coronavirus N protein is known to serve as an RNA chaperone and facilitate template switching (Z¨²?iga et al. 2007, Z¨²?iga et al. 2010). Importantly, the N protein of SARS-CoV-1 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) is also phosphorylated by the?host glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and inhibition of GSK3 was shown to inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-1 (Wu et al. 2009).

Another RNA-binding protein called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) can also bind tightly to SARS-CoV N protein and potentially regulate viral RNA synthesis (Luo et al. 2005).

Signaling through FLT3 occurs after ligand-induced dimerization and transautophosphorylation, and promotes signaling through the MAP kinase, PI3K and STAT5 pathways, among others. FLT3 signaling promotes cellular proliferation and differentiation and contributes to haematopoeisis. FLT3 is mutated in up to 30% of acute myeloid leukemias. ~25% of the FLT3 mutations in AML cases occur as internal tandem duplications (ITDs) either in the juxtamembrane domain region encoded by exon 14 or the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), while ~7-10% of AML cases contain FLT3 missense mutations in the TKD (reviewed?in Klug et al, 2018; Daver et al, 2019).

Each subgenomic RNA contains a leader transcription regulatory sequence (leader TRS) that is identical to the leader of the genome, appended via polymerase ¡°jumping¡± during negative strand synthesis to the body transcription regulatory sequence (body TRS), a short, AU-rich motif of about 10 nucleotides found upstream of each ORF that is destined to become 5' proximal in one of the subgenomic mRNAs. The 3' and 5'UTRs may interact through RNA¨CRNA and/or RNA¨Cprotein plus protein¨Cprotein interactions to promote circularization of the coronavirus genome, placing the elongating minus strand in a favorable topology for leader-body joining. The host protein PABP was found to bind to the coronavirus 3' poly(A) tail and to interact with the host protein eIF-4G, a component of the three-subunit complex that binds to mRNA cap structures, which may promote the circularization of the coronavirus genome. Two viral proteins that bind to the coronavirus 5'UTR, the N protein and nsp1, may play a role in template switching. The poly(A) tail is necessary for the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis at the 3' end of genomic RNA. Elongation of nascent minus strand RNA continues until the first functional body TRS motif is encountered. A fixed proportion of replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) will either disregard the TRS motif and continue to elongate the nascent strand or stop synthesis of the nascent minus strand and relocate to the leader TRS, extending the minus strand by copying the 5' end of the genome. The completed minus-strand RNAs then serve as templates for positive strand mRNA synthesis (reviewed by Sawicki et al. 2007, Yang and Leibowitz 2015).",NA,

The inference process created SARS-CoV-2 events corresponding to each event in the SARS-CoV-1 pathway and populated those events with SARS-CoV-2 protein-containing physical entities based on orthology to SARS-CoV-1 proteins (https://reactome.org/documentation/inferred-events). All of these computationally created events and entities have been reviewed by Reactome curators and modified as appropriate where recently published experimental data indicate the existences of differences between the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways.SARS?CoV?2 infection begins with the binding of viral S (spike) protein to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and endocytosis of the bound virion. Within the endocytic vesicle, host proteases mediate cleavage?of S protein into S1 and S2 fragments, leading to S2?mediated fusion of the viral and host endosome membranes and release of the viral capsid into the host cell cytosol. The capsid is uncoated to free the viral genomic RNA, whose cap?dependent translation produces polyprotein pp1a and, by means of a 1?base frameshift, polyprotein pp1ab. Autoproteolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab generates 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) with various functions. Importantly, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity is encoded in nsp12. Nsp3, 4, and 6 induce rearrangement of the cellular endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form cytosolic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) where the viral replication transcription complex is assembled and anchored. With viral genomic RNA as a template, viral replicase?transcriptase synthesizes a full length negative sense antigenome, which in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of new genomic RNA. The replicase?transcriptase can also switch template during discontinuous transcription of the genome at transcription regulated sequences to produce a nested set of negative?sense subgenomic (sg) RNAs, which are used as templates for the synthesis of positive?sense sgRNAs that are translated to generate viral proteins. Finally, viral particle assembly occurs in the ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Viral M protein provides the scaffold for virion morphogenesis (Hartenian et al. 2020; Fung & Liu 2019; Masters 2006).This Reactome module also describes molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates innate and adaptive immune responses, autophagy, host translation, intracellular signaling and regulatory pathways, and PDZ-mediated cell-cell junctions, mostly annotated from studies of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.",NA,

Although genome replication/transcription is mainly mediated by the viral replicase and confines in the RTC, the involvement of various additional viral and host factors has been implicated. For instance, coronavirus N protein is known to serve as an RNA chaperone and facilitate template switching (Z¨²?iga et al. 2007, Z¨²?iga et al. 2010). Importantly, the N protein of SARS-CoV-1 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) is also phosphorylated by the host glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and inhibition of GSK3 was shown to inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-1 (Wu et al. 2009). Additionally, GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the MHV-JHM N protein recruits an RNA-binding protein DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1), which facilitates template read-through, favoring the synthesis of genomic RNA and longer sgRNAs (Wu et al. 2014). Another RNA-binding protein called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) can also bind tightly to SARS-CoV-1 N protein and potentially regulate viral RNA synthesis (Luo et al. 2005). Host RNA-binding proteins could also bind directly to untranslated regions (UTRs) of the coronavirus genome to modulate replication/transcription, such as zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (ZCRB1) binding to the 5-UTR of IBV (Tan et al. 2012), mitochondrial aconitase binding to the 3' UTR of MHV (Nanda and Leibowitz 2001), and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to the poly(A) tail of bovine coronavirus (Spagnolo and Hogue 2000).

Genomic positive strand RNA is first transcribed into negative sense (minus strand) subgenomic mRNAs by template switching. Negative sense mRNAs subsequently serve as templates for the synthesis of positive strand subgenomic mRNAs.

Due to its similarity with RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2 Rho GTPases, RHOBTB3 is sometimes classified as an atypical member of the RHO GTPase family. However, the GTPase domain of RHOBTB3 is divergent from other Ras-like superfamily members and actually displays ATPase activity (Espinosa et al. 2009). All three RHOBTBs possess other conserved domains in addition to the GTPase domain.

Both catalyze the breakdown of heme into biliverdin (BV), carbon monoxide (CO), and ferrous iron. Biliverdin is immediately reduced to bilirubin (BIL). Both bilirubin and carbon monoxide can localize to different compartments and outside the cell. Cytoprotection by HMOX1 is exerted directly by HMOX1 and by the antioxidant metabolites produced through the degradation of heme. Additionally, due to the reactive nature of labile heme, its degradation is intrinsically protective.HMOX1 confers cytoprotection against cell death in various models of lung and vascular injury by inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, and immune cell proliferation. It binds to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 inflammasome, blocking its activation. In mouse it directly binds STAT3 to control the generation of pathogenic Th17 cells during neutrophilic airway inflammation. It also blocks phosphorylation?of STAT3 by PTK6 and co-inhibits Socs3, a negative feedback factor of Stat3 activation, as well as ROR¦Ãt, thereby decreasing Th2 and Th17 immune responses, and alleviating airway inflammation.The beneficial effects of the three products generated by HMOX1 differ not only in their inherent molecular mechanisms, but also in their downstream cellular targets. To date, this is the only enzymatic system known to exhibit such characteristics. Iron is a vital component of many biological systems and is capable of producing hydroxyl radicals via fenton chemistry. For this reason, iron is sequestered by the storage multimer ferritin and to prevent oxidative damage while maintaining the iron pool. On the other hand, the protective effects of bilirubin and CO are broadly recognized, which has led to their consideration as therapeutics for a range of diseases. Bilirubin has been recognized as one of the most potent antioxidants in nature, and moderate increases of its serum level have been shown in numerous large-scale population and epidemiological studies to have a protective effect against cardiovascular and metabolic disease. These effects are mediated by bilirubin scavenging of superoxide anions and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and by activating the transcription factor PPAR-alpha.CO and biliverdin/bilirubin, have been shown to exert protective effects in the liver against a number of stimuli, as in chronic hepatitis C and in transplanted liver grafts. CO possesses intriguing signaling properties affecting numerous critical cellular functions including but not limited to inflammation, cellular proliferation, and apoptotic cell death. Binding of CO with key ferrous hemoproteins serves as a posttranslational modification that regulates important processes as diverse as aerobic metabolism, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. The most important of these is the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (Cco). By locally blocking mitochondrial respiration the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell is switched off. Additionally CO enables efficient reduction of methemoglobin (MetHb) by H2O2, thus preventing the generation of free heme in hemorrhagic diseases and malaria (Origassa and C?mara, 2013; Morse et al, 2009; Ryter et al, 2006; Cooper and Brown, 2008; Hinds and Stec, 2008).",NA,

Blood plasma contains proteins that scavenge heme. It is estimated that about 2¨C8% of the heme released in plasma becomes ¡®bioavailable¡¯, being internalized by bystander cells. If the heme degradation capacity of a cell, represented by heme oxidase 1 and 2, cannot be ramped up sufficiently then heme signaling and reactivity puts cells under stress. Platelets are activated by heme, and macrophages switch to the inflammatory type (Donegan et al, 2019; Gouveia et al, 2019).Free (labile) heme accumulates in the blood stream in great amounts under pathological conditions like viral infections and malaria, but also ARDS amd COPD. The locally affected cells' primary reaction is to upregulate heme oxidase 1 (HMOX1) expression. HMOX1 induction in these cells not only removes heme from circulation but also triggers a functional switch toward the anti-inflammatory phenotype (Vijayan et al, 2018).?However, heme scavenging and degradation systems may get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of heme present.Heme promotes platelet activation, complement activation, vasculitis, and thrombosis (Bourne et al, 2020; Merle et al, 2018).

It also has a role as corepressor in the circadian clock system (Ko and Takahashi, 2006). BACH1 is regulated by heme in a cell, thus placing heme as a signaling molecule in gene expression in higher eukaryotes. The regulation of BACH1 by heme may be important for the stress response in general (Suzuki et al, 2004).Extracellular hemoglobin, a byproduct of hemolysis, can release its prosthetic heme groups uponoxidation. Due to the reactive nature of free heme, the blood plasma contains proteins that scavenge heme. It is estimated that about 2¨C8% of the heme released in plasma becomes ¡®bioavailable¡¯, being internalized by bystander cells. Failure of nearby cells to sufficientlymetabolize free heme can incite platelet activation, macrophage differentiation, and oxidative stress (Donegan et al, 2019; Gouveia et al, 2019).",NA,

Pyroptosis protects the host from microbial infection but can also lead to pathological inflammation if overactivated or dysregulated (reviewed in Orning P et al. 2019; Tang L et al. 2020). During infections, the excessive production of cytokines can lead to a cytokine storm, which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (reviewed in Tisoncik JR et al. 2012; Karki R et al. 2020; Ragab D et al. 2020). Pyroptosis has a close but complicated relationship?to tumorigenesis, affected by tissue type and genetic background. Pyroptosis can trigger potent antitumor immune responses or serve as an effector mechanism in antitumor immunity (Wang Q et al. 2020; Zhou Z et al. 2020; Zhang Z et al. 2020), while in other cases, as a type of proinflammatory death, pyroptosis can contribute to the formation of a microenvironment suitable for tumor cell growth (reviewed in Xia X et al. 2019; Jiang M et al. 2020; Zhang Z et al. 2021).This Reactome module describes the defective GSDME function caused by cancer?related GSDME mutations (Zhang Z et al. 2020).

Aberrant promoter methylation is considered to be a hallmark of cancer (Ehrlich M et al. 2002; Dong Y et al. 2014; Lam K et al. 2016; Croes L et al. 2018).

Here we have annotated two aspects of cellular responses to amino acid deprivation, ones mediated by EIF2AK4 and ones mediated by mTORC.EIF2AK4 (GCN2) senses amino acid deficiency by binding uncharged tRNAs near the ribosome, and phosphorylating EIF2S1 (reviewed in Chaveroux et al. 2010, Castilho et al. 2014, Gallinetti et al. 2013, Br?er and Br?er 2017, Wek 2018). This reduces translation of most mRNAs but increases translation of mRNAs, notably ATF4, that mediate stress responses (reviewed in Kilberg et al. 2012, Wortel et al. 2017; Dever and Hinnebusch 2005).The mTORC1 complex acts as an integrator that regulates translation, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth in response to multiple inputs, notably glucose, oxygen, amino acids, and growth factors such as insulin (reviewed in Sabatini 2017, Meng et al. 2018, Kim and Guan 2019).MTOR, the kinase subunit of mTORC1, is activated by interaction?with RHEB:GTP at the cytosolic face of lysosomal membrane (Long et al. 2005, Tee et al. 2005, Long et al. 2007, Yang et al. 2017). This process is regulated by various individual amino acids (reviewed in Zhuang et al. 2019, Wolfson and Sabatini 2017, Yao et al. 2017) and is reversed in response to the removal of amino acids, through the action of TSC1 (Demetriades et al. 2014).",NA,

Cytoprotection by HMOX1 is exerted directly by HMOX1 and by the antioxidant metabolites it produces through the degradation of heme (Origassa et al, 2013; Ryter et al, 2006).Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are important mediators of chemical stress, as they are produced endogenously in mitochondria, and also result from redox activities of many toxins and heavy metal cations. The points of RONS action in the cell are plasma and ER membrane lipids, as well as DNA, both acting as sensors for the cellular response. On the other hand, chemotherapeutic?agents exert their action via generation of RONS and induction of cancer cell apoptosis, while drug resistance associates with RONS-induced cancer cell survival (Sampadi et al, 2020; Moldogazieva et al, 2018)",NA,

RAS-like proteins are typically active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. Conversion between the two states is mediated by effector proteins: among others, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) enable hydrolysis of bound GTP to form GDP, which remains bound, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) enable exchange of bound GDP for free GTP (intracellular GTP concentrations are typically an order of magnitude higher than GDP concentrations) (reviewed in Tetlow and Tamanoi, 2013).The human genome includes over 150 members of the RAS superfamily grouped into five main subfamilies: RAS, RHO, ARF, RAB and RAN. These small GTPases affect a wide range of critical processes including gene expression, signal transduction, cell morphology, vesicle and nuclear trafficking, cellular proliferation and motility, among others (reviewed in Tetlow?and Tamanoi, 2013).The RHO family of GTPases is large and diverse, with many of its members considered to be master regulators of actin cytoskeleton, involved in the regulation of cellular processes that depend on dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton, including cell migration, cell adhesion, cell division, establishment of cellular polarity and intracellular transport (reviewed in Hodge and Ridley 2016, and Olson 2018).MIRO proteins and RHOBTB3 protein, sometimes called atypical RHO proteins, show a high degree of overall sequence similarity to members of the five RAS-like subfamilies but diverge in their functions enough to constitute two separate subfamilies (Boureux et al. 2007). MIRO proteins have intrinsically high GTPase activity and do not require GTPase activator proteins (Peters et al. 2018). They play an important role mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance and organization (reviewed in Birsa et al. 2013).

Furthermore, stimulation of IRAK1-deficient I1A 293 cells with LMP1 (latent membrane protein 1- a known viral activator of NF-kappa-B) leads to TRAF6 polyubiquitination and IKKbeta activation [Song et al 2006]. On the other hand, IRAK1 enhances p65 Ser536 phosphorylation [Song et al 2006] and p65 binding to the promoter of NF-kappa-B dependent target genes [Liu G et al 2008].

Mutation of the ubiquitination sites on IRAK1 prevented interaction with the NEMO subunit of IKK complex and subsequent IL-1/TLR-induced NF-kappa-B activation [Conze et al 2008]. These data suggest that kinase activity of IRAK1 is not essential for its ability to activate NF-kappa-B, while its Lys63-polyubuquitination?allows IRAK1 to bind NEMO thus facilitating association of TRAF6 and TAK1 complex with IKK complex followed by induction of NF-kappa-B.

IRAK-2 loss-of-function mutants, with mutated TRAF6-binding motifs, could no longer activate NF-kB and could no longer stimulate TRAF-6 ubiquitination (Keating SE et al 2007). Furthermore, the proxyvirus protein A52 - an inhibitor of all IL-1R/TLR pathways to NF-kB activation, was found to interact with both IRAK-2 and TRAF6, but not IRAK-1. Further work showed that A52 inhibits IRAK-2 functions, whereas association with TRAF6 results in A52-induced MAPK activation. The strong inhibition effect of A52 was also observed on the TLR3-NFkB axis and this observation led to the discovery that IRAK-2 is recruited to TLR3 to activate NF-kB (Keating SE et al 2007). Thus, A52 possibly inhibits MyD88-independent TLR3 pathways to NF-kB via targeting IRAK-2 as it does?for other IL-1R/TLR pathways, although it remains unclear how IRAK-2 is involved in TLR3 signaling.IRAK-2 was shown to have two TRAF6 binding motifs that are responsible for initiating TRAF6 signaling transduction (Ye H et al 2002).",NA,

An exon junction located 50-55 nt downstream of a termination codon is observed to enhance NMD. Exon-junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited on the mRNA during splicing in the nucleus, remain on mRNAs after transport to the cytosol, and are dislodged by the ribosome as it progresses along the mRNA during the pioneer round of translation (Gehring et al. 2009). EJCs contain the core factors eIF4A-III, Magoh-Y14, and CASC3 as well as the peripheral factors RNPS1, UPF2,Â and UPF3. UPF2 and UPF3 recruit UPF1 to eRF3 at the terminating ribosome.

The abnormal accumulation of amyloid, amyloidosis, is a term associated with tissue damage caused by amyloid deposition, seen in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial?event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), though it is unclear whether these intermediate steps are required in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.",NA,

GABA A receptors are fast-acting ligand gated chloride ion channels that mediate membrane depolarization and thus inhibit neurotransmitter release (G Michels et al Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol 42, 2007, 3-14). GABA B receptors are slow acting metabotropic Gprotein coupled receptors that act via the inhibitory action of their Galpha/Go subunits on adenylate cyclase to attenuate the actions of PKA. In addition, their Gbeta/gamma subunits interact directly with N and P/Q Ca2+ channels to decrease the release of Ca2+. GABA B receptors also interact with Kir3 K+ channels and increase the influx of K+, leading to cell membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of channels such as NMDA receptors (A Pinard et al Adv Pharmacol, 58, 2010, 231-55).",NA,

There is an inherent positive feedback loop because the product of C3 activation forms part of an enzyme that causes more C3 activation.2. There is continuous low-level activation of the alternative pathway (see Spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 thioester).Complement cascade activation is regulated by a family of related proteins termed the regulators of complement activation (RCA). These are expressed on healthy host cells. Most pathogens do not express RCA proteins on their surface, but many have found ways to evade the complement system by stably binding the RCA that circulates in human plasma (Lambris et al. 2008); trapping RCA is by far the most widely employed strategy for avoiding the complement response. RCA recruitment is common in bacteria such as E. coli and streptococci (Kraiczy & Wurzner 2006) and has also been described for viruses, fungi and parasites. RCA deposition and the complement system?also have an important role in tissue homeostasis, clearing dead cells and debris, and preventing damage from oxidative stress (Weismann et al. 2011).RCA proteins control complement activation in two different ways; by promoting the irreversible dissociation (decay acceleration) of complement convertases and by acting as cofactors for Complement factor I (CFI)-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b.Decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), Complement factor H (FH), Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP) and Complement receptor 1 (CR1) are composed of arrays of tandem globular domains termed CCPs (complement control protein repeats) or SCRs (short consensus repeats). CR1, MCP and FH are cofactors for the CFI-mediated cleavage of C3b, generating iC3b. CR1 and MCP are also cofactors for C4b cleavage.

GH also has insulin-like effects such as stimulating amino acid transport, protein synthesis, glucose transport, and lipogenesis. The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a a member of the cytokine receptor family.

The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system plays a central role in the generation of these class I MHC antigens. Ubiquitination is the mechanism of adding ubiquitin to lysine residues on substrate protein leading to the formation of a polyubiquitinated substrate. This process involves three classes of enzyme, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Polyubiquitination through lysine-48 (K48) generally targets the substrate protein for proteasomal destruction. The protease responsible for the degradation of K48-polyubiquitinated proteins is the 26S proteasome. This proteasome is a two subunit protein complex composed of the 20S (catalytic core) and 19S (regulatory) proteasome complexes. The proteasome eliminates most of the foreign and?non-functional proteins from the cell by degrading them into short peptides; only a small fraction of the peptides generated are of the correct length to be presented by the MHC class I system.

As MKs mature they undergo endoreduplication (polyploidisation) and expansion of cytoplasmic mass to cell sizes larger than 50-100 microns, and ploidy ranges up to 128 N. As MKs mature, the polyploid nucleus becomes horseshoe-shaped, the cytoplasm expands, and platelet organelles and the demarcation membrane system are amplified. Proplatelet projections form which give rise to de novo circulating platelets (Deutsch & Tomer 2006). The processes of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production occur within a complex microenvironment where chemokines, cytokines and adhesive interactions play major roles (Avecilla et al. 2004). Megakaryocytopoiesis is regulated at several levels including proliferation, differentiation and platelet release (Kaushansky 2003). Thrombopoietin (TPO/c-Mpl ligand) is the most potent cytokine stimulating?proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors (Kaushansky 2005) but many other growth factors are involved. MK development is controlled by the action of multiple transcription factors. Many MK-specific genes are co-regulated by GATA and friend of GATA (FOG), RUNX1 and ETS proteins. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2), which has an MK-erythroid specific 45-kDa subunit, controls terminal MK maturation, proplatelet formation and platelet release (Schulze & Shivdasani 2004). NF-E2 deficient mice have profound thrombocytopenia (Shiraga et al. 1999). MYB (c-myb) functions with EP300 (p300) as a negative regulator of thrombopoiesis (Metcalf et al. 2005). During MK maturation, internal membrane systems, granules and organelles are assembled. Cytoplasmic fragmentation requires changes in the MK cytoskeleton and formation of organelles and channels. Individual organelles migrate from the cell body to the proplatelet ends, with approximately 30 percent of organelles/granules in motion at any given time (Richardson et al. 2005).",NA,

All of these compounds share common intermediates and almost all can be biosynthesized from one another. Serine and glycine are not essential amino acids and can be synthesized from a number of routes. For example, serine can be synthesized via glycerate, which can be converted to glycerate 3-phosphate (via glycerate kinase), which in turn is converted to phosphohydroxypyruvate and then phosphoserine and finally serine. The serine synthesized via this route, can create cysteine and glycine through the homocysteine cycle. Cystathionine beta-synthase catalyses the condensation of homocysteine and serine to give cystathionine. Cystathionine beta-lyase then converts this double amino acid to cysteine, ammonia, and Î±-ketoglutarate. Serine can also be used in polypeptide synthesis (via Seryl-tRNA synthetase) or in phosphatidylserine synthesis. Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine. In most organisms, the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyses this transformation using tetrahydrofolate (THF), leading to methylene THF and glycine. Glycine can be degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals involves the Glycine Cleavage System. This leads to the degradation of glycine into ammonia and CO2. In the second pathway, glycine is degraded in two steps. The first step is the reverse of glycine biosynthesis from serine with serine hydroxymethyl transferase. Serine is then converted to pyruvate by serine dehydratase. In the third route to glycine degradation, glycine is converted to glyoxylate by D-amino acid oxidase.

The processes shown in this pathway include transport reactions by which folates are taken up by cells and moved intracellularly, folate conjugation with glutamate (required for folate retention within a cell), as well as the synthesis of pterines, which are used in folate synthesis. Two branches are depicted: Pterin synthesis and Folate biosynthesis. In pterin synthesis, GTP is the precursor for pterin biosynthesis. The enzyme GTP-cyclohydrolase I produces dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP as the first step. The product is then dephosphorylated to dihydroneopterin and yields, after removal of a C2-residue from the C3-side chain 6- hydroxymethyldihydropterin, which is the precursor for folate biosynthesis. In terms of folate biosynthesis, the basic steps are: folate â?dihydrofolate â?tetrahydrofolate â?methylene-THF â?methyl-THF. More specifically, the pathway leading to the formation of tetrahydrofolate (FH4) begins when folate (F) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) (FH2), which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step. Vitamin B3 in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. Methylene-THF (CH2FH4) is formed from THF by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Methyl tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. Another form of THF, formyl-THF (or folinic acid) results from oxidation of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Finally, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.",NA,

Half of the phenylalanine required goes into the production of tyrosine; if the diet is rich in tyrosine itself, the requirements for phenylalanine are reduced by about 50%. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is a mixed-function oxygenase: one atom of oxygen is incorporated into water and the other into the hydroxyl of tyrosine. The reductant is the tetrahydrofolate-related cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, which is maintained in the reduced state by the NADH-dependent enzyme dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR). The catabolism of tyrosine starts with an Î±-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase, which generates p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The next oxidation step is catalyzed by p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate-dioxygenase and generates homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentistate-oxygenase is required. Through this reaction, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetate is then generated by maleylacetoacetate-cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split into acetoactate and fumarate via fumarylacetoacetate-hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis.",NA,

Tyrosine is found in many high protein food products such as soy products, chicken, turkey, fish, peanuts, almonds, avocados, bananas, milk, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, lima beans, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds.  Tyrosine can be converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline).  Depicted in this pathway is the conversion of phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate (via amino acid oxidase or tyrosine amino transferase acting on phenylalanine), the incorporation of phenylalanine and/or tyrosine into polypeptides (via tyrosyl tRNA synthetase and phenylalyl tRNA synthetase) and the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine via phenylalanine hydroxylase.  This reaction functions both as the first step in tyrosine/phenylalanine catabolism by which the body disposes of excess phenylalanine, and as a source of the amino acid tyrosine.

The cytosolic enzymes such as argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) will synthesize citrulline into argininosuccinic acid, and then argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) will synthesize further from argininosuccinic acid to arginine. Glutamate and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (glutamate's precursor) will biosynthesize to form proline. Citrulline is derived from ornithine through proline, glutamine or glutamate's catabolism. Generation of proline and glutamate from ornithine in mitochondria is important since many of the reactions required proline and glutamate. Because of arginine, glutamine, and proline related sub-pathways are all bidirectional; hence, cell type and developmental stage of the cell will mainly decide the net utilization or production of these amino acids. In small intestine, epithelial cells will produce citrulline from glutamine and glutamate primarily; alongside with the extraction of citrulline from circulation via kidney's proximal tubule cells, and then convert citrulline into arginine for returning back to circulation. Therefore, the damage or impariment of small bowel or renal function will greatly increasing the dietary requirement due to the reducing of endogenous arginine synthesis. Proline and arginine (protegenic amino acids) will incorporate into proteins by prolyl-tRNA and arginyl-tRNA with synthesis of their respective tRNA synthetases. In epithelial cells, ornithine is used primarily to synthesize citrulline and arginine, which make it as a key component of the arginine/proline metabolic pathway.

Taurine is a derivative of the sulfur-containing (sulfhydryl) amino acid, cysteine.  For mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the pancreas via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway.  In this pathway, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine is first oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase.  Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine.  Taurine is conjugated via its amino terminal group with chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid to form the bile salts sodium taurochenodeoxycholate and sodium taurocholate.  This reaction is catalyzed by BAAT (bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acetyltransferase).  In the body, this reaction occurs in hepatocytes and is the means by which bile acids recovered from the intestine are converted to bile salts before being released again into the bile.

These are joined together via HMG-CoA synthase to produce hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which is then reduced to mevalonic acid via the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.  HMG-CoA reductase is the protein target of many cholesterol lowering drugs called statins.  The mevaolonic acid is then phosphorylated by mevalonate kinase and subsequently decarboxylated to form isopentylpyrophosphate (IPP).  IPP can also be isomerized to form dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP).  Isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallylpyrophosphate donate isoprene units, which can be joined together to make farnesyl and geranylgeranyl intermediates.  Specifically, three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase.  Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol.  Lanosterol is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, which is the compound from which all steroids are derived.  14-Demethylation of lanosterol by CYP51 eventually yields cholesterol.  It can be obtained from animal fats consumed in the diet or synthesized de novo (as described above).  Cholesterol is an essential constituent of lipid bilayer membranes and is the starting point for the biosyntheses of bile acids and salts, steroid hormones, and vitamin D.  Bile acids and salts, e. g. , taurocholate, are mostly synthesized in the liver.  They are released into the intestine and function as detergents to solubilize dietary fats.  Steroid hormones are mostly synthesized in the adrenal gland and gonads.  They regulate energy metabolism and stress responses (glucocorticoids such as cortisol), salt balance (mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone), and sexual development and function (androgens and estrogens such as estradiol).",NA,

Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is also called 5-aminolevulinic acid. Following its synthesis ALA is transported to the cytosol, where ALA dehydratase (also called porphobilinogen synthase) dimerizes 2 molecules of ALA to produce porphobilinogen. The next step in the pathway involves the head-to-tail condensation of 4 molecules of porphobilinogen to produce hydroxymethylbilane. The enzyme for this condensation is porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG deaminase). This enzyme is also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase or uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Hydroxymethylbilane has two main fates. The most important fate is conversion to uroporphyrinogen III, the next intermediate on the path to heme. This step is mediated by uroporphyrinogen synthase and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. Hydroxymethylbilane can also non-enzymatically cyclized to form uroporphyrinogen I. In the cytosol, the acetate substituents of uroporphyrinogen (uroporphyrinogen III or uroporphyrinogen I) are all decarboxylated by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. The resultant products have methyl groups in place of acetate and are known as coproporphyrinogens, with coproporphyrinogen III being the important normal intermediate in heme synthesis. Coproporphyrinogen III is transported to the interior of the mitochondrion, where 2 propionate residues are decarboxylated, yielding vinyl substituents on the 2 pyrrole rings. The colorless product is protoporphyrinogen IX. In the mitochondrion, protoporphyrinogen IX is converted to protoporphyrin IX by protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase. The final reaction in heme synthesis also takes place in the mitochondria and involves the insertion of the iron atom into the ring system generating heme b. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is known as ferrochelatase. Heme is broken down when the heme ring is opened by the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme, heme oxygenase. This oxidation step requires heme as a substrate, and any hemin (Fe3+) is reduced to heme (Fe2+) prior to oxidation by heme oxygenase. The oxidation occurs on a specific carbon producing the linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin, ferric iron (Fe3+), and carbon monoxide (CO). This is the only reaction in the body that is known to produce CO. In the next reaction a second bridging methylene (between rings III and IV) is reduced by biliverdin reductase, producing bilirubin. Bilirubin is significantly less extensively conjugated than biliverdin causing a change in the color of the molecule from blue-green (biliverdin) to yellow-red (bilirubin). In hepatocytes, bilirubin-UDP-glucuronyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) adds 2 equivalents of glucuronic acid to bilirubin to produce the more water soluble, bilirubin diglucuronide derivative.",NA,

Phospholipids can be synthesized by two mechanisms. One utilizes a CDP-activated polar head group for attachment to the phosphate of phosphatidic acid. The other utilizes CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol and an inactivated polar head group. Phospholipids are synthesized in the ER membrane from cytosolic precursors. Two fatty acids linked to coenzyme A (CoA) carriers are first joined to glycerol-3-phosphate, yielding phosphatidic acid, which is simultaneously inserted into the membrane. A phosphatase then converts phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol. The attachment of different polar head groups to diacylglycerol then results in formation of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylinositol is formed from phosphatidic acid, rather than from diacylglycerol. Initially, most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone. However, the fatty acid distribution at the Câ? and Câ? positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. In many cases the acyl group which was initially transferred to glycerol, by the action of the acyl transferases, is not the same acyl group present in the phospholipid when it resides within a membrane. The remodeling of acyl groups in phospholipids is the result of the action of phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2).

Coenzyme A (CoA) may act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds and is used as a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA, and for Î±-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also important in the biosynthesis of many important compounds such as fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. About 85% of dietary pantothenic acid is as CoA or phosphopentetheine. In the intestinal lumen, these undergo hydrolysis to phosphopantetheine, then pantetheine. Intestinal mucosal cells have high pantetheinase activity and rapidly hydrolyze pantetheine to yield free pantothenic acid. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process from pantothenate. First, antothenate (Vitamin B5) is phosphorylated to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase, next a cysteine is added to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). In the next step, PPC is decarboxylated to 4'-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase. In the fourth step, 4'-phosphopantetheine is adenylylated to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase. Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated using ATP to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. CoA undergoes dephosphorylation, catalyzed by lysosomal acid phosphatasae to dephospho-CoA, followed by pyrophosphatase action to release 4â?phosphotantetheine and 5âAMP.

This acid can not be oxidized through beta-oxidation, as problems arise when water is added at the branched beta-carbon. To be able to oxidize this fatty acid, the carbon is oxidized by oxygen, which removes the initial carboxyl group, which shortens the chain. Now lacking a methyl group, this chain can be beta-oxidized. Now moving to the mitochondria, there are four reactions that occur, and are repeated for each molecule of the fatty acid. Each time the cycle of these reactions is completed, the chain is relieved of two carbons, which are oxidized and are taken away by NADH and FADH2, energy carriers that collect the carbons energy. After beta-oxidation in the cycle of reactions, an acetyl-CoA unit is released and is recycled into the cycle of reactions in the mitochondria, until the chain is fully broken down into acetyl-CoA, and can enter the TCA cycle.

It is responsible for the generation of a substantial fraction of the cytoplasmic NADPH required for biosynthetic reactions, and for the generation of ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis.  Although the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis are distinct, they involve three common intermediates: glucose 6-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate, so the two pathways are interconnected.  Dietary pentose sugars derived from the digestion of nucleic acids may be metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway, and the carbon skeletons of dietary carbohydrates may be converted into glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates.  The pentose phosphate pathway consists of a total of eight reactions:1) Conversion glucose 6-phosphate to D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 2) Conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; 3) Conversion of 6-phospho-D-gluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 4) Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate; 5) Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate; 6) Rearrangement of ribose 5-phosphate and xylulose 5-phosphate to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 7) Rearrangement of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate; and 8) Rearrangement of xylulose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.

Isovaleryl-CoA is produced from leucine by these two reactions, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA from isoleucine, and isobutyryl-CoA from valine. These acyl-CoA¡¯s undergo dehydrogenation, catalyzed by three different but related enzymes, and the breakdown pathways then diverge. Leucine is ultimately converted into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; isoleucine into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA; and valine into propionyl-CoA (and subsequently succinyl-CoA). Under fasting conditions, substantial amounts of all three amino acids are generated by protein breakdown. In muscle, the final products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine catabolism can be fully oxidized via the citric acid cycle; in the liver, they can be directed toward the synthesis of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA) and glucose (succinyl-CoA). Because isoleucine catabolism terminates with the production of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, it is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Because leucine gives rise to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, it is classified as strictly ketogenic.",NA,

These pathways share 3 common reactions with both including the conversion of methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),the utilization of SAM in diverse transmethylation reactions yielding a methylated product plus S-adenosylhomocysteine, and the cleavage of S-adenosylhomocysteine to yield homocysteine and adenosine. The transulfuration reactions that produce cysteine from homocysteine and serine also produce Î±-ketobutyrate, the latter being converted first to propionyl-CoA and then via a 3-step process to succinyl-CoA. Regulation of the methionine metabolic pathway is based on the availability of methionine and cysteine. If both amino acids are present in adequate quantities, SAM accumulates and is a positive effector on cystathionine synthase, encouraging the production of cysteine and Î±-ketobutyrate (both of which are glucogenic). However, if methionine is scarce, SAM will form only in small quantities, thus limiting cystathionine synthase activity.",NA,

The core of sphingolipids is the long-chain amino alcohol, sphingosine. Amino acylation, with a long chain fatty acid, at carbon 2 of sphingosine yields a ceramide. The sphingolipids include the sphingomyelins and glycosphingolipids (the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides). Sphingomyelins are the only sphingolipid that are phospholipids. Sphingolipids are a component of all membranes but are particularly abundant in the myelin sheath. De novo sphingolipid synthesis begins with formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by a (dihydro)-ceramide synthase to form dihydroceramide. This is desaturated to form ceramide. Ceramide may subsequently have several fates. It may be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate. Alternatively, it may be glycosylated by glucosylceramide synthase or galactosylceramide synthase. Additionally, it can be converted to sphingomyelin by the addition of a phosphorylcholine headgroup by sphingomyelin synthase. Diacylglycerol is also generated via this process. Finally, ceramide may be broken down by a ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate, which may, in turn, be dephosphorylated to regerenate sphingosine. Sphingolipid catabolism allows the reversion of these metabolites to ceramide. The complex glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide. These lipids are then hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases to regenerate ceramide. Similarly, sphingomyelin may be broken down by sphingomyelinase to create ceramide. The only route by which sphingolipids are converted to non-sphingolipids is through sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This forms ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.",NA,

They are conjugated with taurine or the amino acid glycine, or with a sulfate or a glucuronide, and are then stored in the gallbladder.  Upon eating a meal, the contents of the gallbladder are secreted into the intestine, where bile acids serve the purpose of emulsifying dietary fats.  Bile acids serve other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate catabolites from the liver, emulsifying lipids and fat soluble vitamins in the intestine, and aiding in the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract.  Bile acids formed by synthesis in the liver are termed ""primary"" bile acids, and those made by bacteria are termed ""secondary"" bile acids.  In the liver, synthesis of bile acids and bile salts is initiated with the conversion of cholesterol esters (from circulating lipoprotein particles) to cholesterol, then to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol then to 4-cholesten-7alpha-ol-3-one.  The pathway then branches: hydroxylation of 4-cholesten-7alpha-ol-3-one to 4-cholesten-7alpha, 12alpha-diol-3-one leads ultimately to the formation of cholate, while its reduction to 5beta-cholestan-7alpha-ol-3-one leads to the formation of chenodeoxycholate.  Chenodeoxycholate has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3-alpha and 7-alpha and is a key bile acid.  Its chief drawback lies in the ability of intestinal bacteria to remove the 7-alpha hydroxyl group via dehydroxylation.  The resulting bile acid has only a 3-alpha hydroxyl group and is termed lithocholic acid.  To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most mammals add a third hydroxyl group at the 12 position to chenodeoxycholic acid to create cholic acid.  In this manner, the subsequent removal of the 7-alpha hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will result in a less toxic, still functional dihydroxy bile acid.  In the intestine, cholic acid is dehydroxylated to form the dihydroxy bile acid deoxycholic acid.  Prior to secretion by the liver, they are conjugated with either the amino acid glycine or taurine through conversion to a Coenzyme A derivative and subsequent conjugation.  In the body, glycocholate, taurocholate, glycochenodeoxycholate, and taurochenodeoxycholate are released from hepatocytes into the bile and ultimately into the lumen of the small intestine, where they function as detergents to solubilize dietary fats.  Conjugation increases water solubility, preventing passive re-absorption once secreted into the small intestine.  As a result, the concentration of bile acids in the small intestine can stay high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids.  Bile acids, in particular chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA), can regulate the expression of genes involved in their synthesis, thereby, creating a feed-back loop.  The elucidation of this regulatory pathway came about as a consequence of the isolation of a class of receptors called the farnesoid X receptors, FXRs.  The FXRs belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that includes the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family as well as the liver X receptors (LXRs), retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).  The FXR genes are expressed at highest levels in the intestine and liver.",NA,

The synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells) or from glycerol itself.  Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid.  Once synthesized, lysophosphatidic acid is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid.  Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.  Specifically, diacylglycerol is formed by the action of phosphatidate phosphatase on phosphatidic acid coupled with the release of a phosphate.  The phosphatase exists as 3 isozymes.  Diacylglycerol is a precursor to triacylglycerol (triglyceride), which is formed in the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase.  Since diacylglycerol is synthesized via phosphatidic acid, it will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.  When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream.  The glycerol component can be converted to glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism.  The fatty acids go through beta-oxidation which splits the long carbon chains of the fatty acid into acetyl CoA, which can eventually enter the TCA cycle.  The energy yield from a gram of fatty acids is approximately 9 Kcal (39 kJ), compared to 4 Kcal/g (17 kJ/g) for carbohydrates.  Since the hydrocarbon portion of fatty acids is hydrophobic, these molecules, can be stored in a relatively anhydrous (water free) environment.  Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are more highly hydrated.  For example, 1 g of glycogen can bind approximately 2 g of water, which translates to 1. 33 Kcal/g (4 Kcal/3 g).  This means that fatty acids can hold more than six times the amount of energy. 5 lb (31 kg) of hydrated glycogen to have the energy equivalent to 10 lb (5 kg) of fat.  Also shown in this pathway is the synthesis of various mono-and diglycosyldiacylglyerols.  These relatively rare lipids exist in both diacyl and alkyl acyl forms, and contain mainly saturated and monoenoic fatty acid components, with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 comprising 90% or more of the total.  The carbohydrate moieties in these glycolipids may consist of galactose or glucose.  The biosynthesis of the galactosyldiacylglycerols has been studied in vitro and there appears to be an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to diacylglycerol.  The function of the galactolipids is still a matter for conjecture.  They probably have a role in myelination, and may also have a function in cell differentiation and intracellular signalling.  The glucolipids in saliva and related secretions may be involved in a defense mechanism against microbial attack.",NA,

The biosynthesis of histidine in adults begins with the condensation of ATP and PRPP (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate) to form N-5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (phosphoribosyl-ATP).  It is also worth noting that PRPP is the starting point for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.  Subsequent histidine biosynthetic steps (from phosphoribosyl-ATP onwards) likely take place in the intestinal microflora.  Elimination of the phosphate and the opening of the ring in phosphoribosyl-ATP forms phosphoribosyl-forminino-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (phosphoribosyl-formimino-AICAR-phosphate).  This is subsequently converted to 5-phosphoribulosyl-forminino-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.  Cleavage of this intermediate results in the formation of imidazole glyercol phosphate and AICAR (aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide) with glutamine playing a role as an amino group donor.  AICAR is recycled through the purine pathway while the imidazole glycerol phosphate is converted to imidazole acetal phosphate.  Transamination yields histidinol phosphate which is converted to histidinol and finally to histidine.  Histidine catabolism begins with release of the Î±-amino group catalyzed by histidase, leading to the deaminated product, urocanate.  Urocanate is converted to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate via the action of urocanate hydratase.  The latter product is then converted to N-formiminoglutamte via the action of imidazolone propionase.  The enzyme formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase then removes the formimino group to yield glutamate.  Because the end product of histidine catabolism is glutamate this makes histidine one of the glucogenic amino acids.  Another key feature of histidine catabolism is that it serves as a source of ring nitrogen to combine with tetrahydrofolate (THF), producing the 1-carbon THF intermediate known as N5-formiminoTHF.  The latter reaction is one of two routes to N5-formiminoTHF.  Decarboxylation of histidine in the intestine by bacteria gives rise to histamine.  Similarly, histamine arises in many tissues by the decarboxylation of histidine, which in excess causes constriction or dilation of various blood vessels.  Once histamine is generated it can be converted to several breakdown products including N-methylhistamine, imidazole acetaldehyde, methylimidazole acetaldehyde and methylimidazole-acetic acid.  Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis (via carnosine synthase), with beta-alanine being the rate limiting precursor.   Anserine can be synthesized either from carnosine via carnosine N-methyltransferase or from 1-methylhistidine via carnosine synthase.   Inversely, cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase catalyzes the synthesis of 1-methylhistidine from anserine.",NA,

Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidine derivatives. Synthesis of the pyrimidines is less complex than that of the purines, since the base is much simpler This pathway depicts a number of processes including pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, pyrimidine degradation and pyrimidine salvage. Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis begins with carbamoyl phosphate. The carbamoyl phosphate used for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is derived from glutamine and bicarbonate and is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPS-II). Subsequently carbamoyl phosphate is incorporated into the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway through the action of aspartate transcarbamoylase, ATCase which generates carbamoyl aspartate. This is then converted to dihydroorotic acid via carbamoyl aspartate dehydrogenase, which is then converted to orotic acid via dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase incorporate PRPP to produce orotidine monophosphate (OMP) which is converted to UMP (uridine monopohophsate) via orotidine-5â?phosphate carboxylase. Following completion of UMP synthesis it can be phosphorylated to UTP and utilized as a substrate for CTP synthase for the synthesis of CTP. Specifically, UMP is phosphorylated twice to yield UTP. The first phosphorylation is catalyzed by uridylate kinase and the second by ubiquitous nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Finally UTP is aminated by the action of CTP synthase, generating CTP. Uridine nucleotides are also the precursors for de novo synthesis of the thymine nucleotides. The de novo pathway to thymidine nucleotdie synthesis first requires the use of deoxyUMP from the metabolism of either UDP or CDP. The deoxyUMP is converted to deoxyTMP by the action of thymidylate synthase. The methyl group is donated by N5,N10-methylene THF. In order for the thymidylate synthase reaction to continue, THF must be regenerated from DHF. This is accomplished through the action of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). THF is then converted to N5,N10-THF via the action of serine hydroxymethyl transferase. The synthesis of pyrimidines differs in two significant ways from that of purines. First, the ring structure is assembled as a free base, not built upon PRPP. Second, there is no branch in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. The salvage pathway to dTTP synthesis involves the enzyme thymidine kinase which can use either thymidine or deoxyuridine as a substrate. Uracil can be salvaged to form UMP through the concerted action of uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase. Formation of dTMP, by salvage of dTMP requires the action of thymine phosphorylase and thymidine kinase while the salvage of deoxycytidine is catalyzed by deoxycytidine kinase. Deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine are also substrates for deoxycytidine kinase. In terms of the catabolism of pyrimidines, they are ultimately degraded to CO2, H2O, and urea. Cytosine can be broken down to uracil which can be further broken down to N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine and then to beta-alanine. Thymine is broken down into Î²-aminoisobutyrate. The Î²-alanine and Î²-aminoisobutyrate serve as -NH2 donors in the transamination of Î±-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A subsequent reaction converts the products to malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA (which is converted to succinyl-CoA and can be shunted to the TCA cycle).",NA,

When NAD+ and NADP+ are interchanged in a reaction with their reduced forms, NADH and NADPH respectively, they are important cofactors in several hundred redox reactions. NAD+ is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a de novo pathway from amino acids, or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD+. Most organisms synthesize NAD+ de novo from simple components. The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from tryptophan (Trp) in animals, or aspartic acid in some bacteria (intestinal microflora) and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose group. An adenylate group is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid group in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) group, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In a further step, some NAD+ is converted into NADP+ by NAD+ kinase, which phosphorylates NAD+. Besides assembling NAD+ de novo from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing nicotinamide. Although other precursors are known, the three natural compounds containing the nicotinamide ring and used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (Na), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). The precursors are fed into the NAD+ biosynthetic pathwaythrough adenylation and phosphoribosylation reactions. These compounds can be taken up from the diet, where the mixture of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are called vitamin B3 or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells, when the nicotinamide group is released from NAD+ in ADP-ribose transfer reactions.",NA,

Purines, including substituted purines, are the most widely distributed kind of nitrogen-containing heterocycle in nature. The two most important purines are adenine and guanine. Other notable purines are hypoxanthine, xanthine, theobromine, caffeine, uric acid and isoguanine. Purines are found in a number of other important biomolecules, such as ATP, GTP, cyclic AMP, NADH, and coenzyme A. This pathway depicts a number of processes including purine nucleotide biosynthesis, purine degradation and purine salvage. The major site of purine nucleotide synthesis is in the liver. Synthesis of the purine nucleotides begins with PRPP and leads to the first fully formed nucleotide, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMP synthesis begins with 5-phospho-Î±-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, PRPP. Through a series of reactions utilizing ATP, tetrahydrofolate (THF) derivatives, glutamine, glycine and aspartate this pathway yields IMP. The rate limiting reaction is catalyzed by glutamine PRPP amidotransferase which drives the reaction with PRPP and glutamine yielding 5-phosphoribosylamine (PRA). 5-phosphoribosylamine is converted to glycinamide ribotide (GAR) then to formyglycinamide ribotide (FGAR). This set of reactions is catalyzed by a trifunctional enzyme containing GAR synthetase, GAR transformylase and AIR synthetase. FGAR is converted to formylglycinamidine-ribonucleotide (FGAM) by formylglycinamide synthase. FGAM is then converted by aminoimidzaole ribotide synthase to 5-aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR) then carboxylated by aminoimidazole ribotide carboxylase to carboxyaminoimidazole ribotide (CAIR). CAIR is then converted to succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) by succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide synthase followed by conversion to AICAR (via adenylsuccinate lyase) then to FAICAR (via aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide transformylase). FAICAR is finally converted to inosine monophosphate (IMP) by IMP cyclohydrolase. Because of the complexity of this synthetic process, the purine ring is actually composed of atoms derived from many different molecules. The N1 atom arises from the amine group of Asp, the C2 and C8 atoms originate from formate, the N3 and N9 atoms come from the amide group of Gln, the C4, C5 and N7 atoms come from Gly and the C6 atom comes from CO2. IMP represents a branch point for purine biosynthesis, because it can be converted into either AMP or GMP through two distinct reaction pathways. AMP is generated from IMP via adenylsuccinate synthetase (which adds aspartate) and adenylsuccinate lyase. GMP is generated via the action of IMP dehydrogenase and GMP synthase. Catabolism of purine nucleotides ultimately leads to the production of uric acid. Beginning from AMP, the enzymes AMP deaminase and nucleotidase work in concert to generate inosine. Alternately, AMP may be dephosphorylate by nucleotidase and then adenosine deaminase (ADA) converts the free adenosine to inosine. The enzyme purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP) converts inosine to hypoxanthine, while xanthine oxidase converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and finally to uric acid. GMP and XMP can also be converted to uric acid via the action of nucleotidase, PNP, guanine deaminase and xanthine oxidase. The synthesis of nucleotides from the purine bases and purine nucleosides takes place in a series of steps known as the salvage pathways. The free purine bases, adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine, can be reconverted to their corresponding nucleotides by phosphoribosylation. Two key transferase enzymes are involved in the salvage of purines: adenosine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), which catalyzes the conversion of adenine to AMP and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP.",NA,

In mammals, beta-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, whereas plants and most fungi harbor the beta-oxidation cycle only in the peroxisomes.  However, the oxidation ceases at octanyl CoA.  It is believed that very long chain (greater than C-22) fatty acids undergo initial oxidation in peroxisomes which is followed by mitochondrial oxidation.  One significant difference is that oxidation in peroxisomes is not coupled to ATP synthesis.  Instead, the high-potential electrons are transferred to O2, which yields H2O2.  The enzyme catalase, found exclusively in peroxisomes, converts the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.  Peroxisomal Î²-oxidation also requires enzymes specific to the peroxisome and to very long fatty acids.  There are three key differences between the enzymes used for mitochondrial and peroxisomal Î²-oxidation: beta-oxidation in the peroxisome requires the use of a peroxisomal carnitine acyltransferase (instead of carnitine acyltransferase I and II used by the mitochondria) for transport of the activated acyl group into the peroxisome.  The first oxidation step in the peroxisome is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl CoA oxidase.  The beta-ketothiolase used in peroxisomal beta-oxidation has an altered substrate specificity, different from the mitochondrial beta-ketothiolase.  In mitochondria, the beta-oxidation pathway includes four reactions that occur in repeating cycles with each fatty acid molecule.  In each cycle, a fatty acid is progressively shortened by two carbons as it is oxidized and its energy captured by the reduced energy carriers NADH and FADH2.  At the end of each cycle of four reactions, one acetyl-CoA two-carbon unit is released from the end of the fatty acid, which then goes through another round of beta-oxidation, continuing to oxidize and shorten even-chain fatty acids until they are entirely converted to acetyl-CoA.  The acetyl-CoA generated in beta-oxidation enters the TCA cycle, where it is further oxidized to CO2, producing more reduced energy carriers, NADH and FADH2.  These carriers produced in the TCA cycle, along with those produced directly in beta-oxidation, transfer their energy to the electron transport chain where they drive the creation of the proton gradient that supports mitochondrial ATP production.  Another destination of acetyl-CoA is the production of ketone bodies by the liver that are transported to tissues like the heart and brain for energy.",NA,

Folic acid participates in both the activation of single carbons as well as in the oxidation and reduction of single carbons. Folate-dependent single-carbon reactions are important in amino acid metabolism and in biosynthetic pathways leading to DNA, RNA, membrane lipids, and neurotransmitters. To carry out the transfer of 1-carbon units, NADPH must reduce folic acid two times in the cell. The pyrazine ring of the 6-methylpterin is reduced at each of the two N-C double bonds. More precisely, the pathway leading to the formation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) begins when folate (F) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step. Vitamin B3 in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. The resulting 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) is the acceptor of 1-carbon groups. Tetrahydrofolate accepts methyl groups, usually from serine. The product, N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, is the central compound in 1-carbon metabolism. Methylene-THF (CH2FH4) is formed from THF by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Tetrahydrofolate can also accept a methyl group from the complete breakdown of glycine. The N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate can either donate its single-carbon group directly, be oxidized by NADP to the methenyl form, or be reduced by NADH to the methyl form. Depending on the biosynthetic pathway involved, any of these species can donate the 1-carbon group to an acceptor. The methylene form donates its methyl group during the biosynthesis of thymidine nucleotides for DNA synthesis, the methenyl form donates its group as a formyl group during purine biosynthesis, and the methyl form is the donor of the methyl group to sulfur during methionine formation. Methyl tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. Another form of THF, formyl-THF or folinic acid) results from oxidation of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Finally, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.",NA,

Longer chain fatty acids are found in certain specialized tissues (myelin contains high amounts of C22 and C24 components). Even longer chain fatty acids are derived from either dietary sources or from elongation of C16-CoA or C18-CoA formed by the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthetase system. All of the fatty acids needed by the body can be synthesized from palmitate (C16:0) except the essential, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleate and linolenate. To create longer, shorter, oxidized, reduced fatty acids, palmitic acid is subjected to enzymatic reactions by reductases, hydroxylases, elongases and mixed function oxidases. There are 3 major processes that modify palmitic acid: elongation, desaturation and hydroxylation. Elongation of fatty acids may occur at endoplasmic reticulum where fatty acid molecules of length up to C24 may be produced. Mitochondrial elongation may result in fatty acids up to C16 in length. Fatty acid elongation in mitochondria is essentially the reverse of beta-oxidation for fatty acid oxidation. In particular, both pathways make use of acetyl-CoA acyltransferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratase. The final step of fatty acid elongation uses enoyl-CoA reductase (not part of the beta-oxidation pathway). The elongation takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. In liver and kidney fatty acid elongation operates best in the presence of both NADH and NADPH, whereas in heart and skeletal muscle, only NADH is required. The mitochondrial pathway is important for elongating fatty acids containing 14 or fewer carbon atoms. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of less than six carbons.

L-Alanine will be coupled with alanyl tRNA by alanyl-tRNA synthetase to perform protein biosynthesis. Alanine constitutes about 8% of human proteins. Under fasting conditions, alanine, derived from protein breakdown, can be converted to pyruvate and used to synthesize glucose via gluconeogenesis in the liver. Alternately, alanine, after conversion to pyruvate, can be fully oxidized via the TCA cycle in other tissues.",NA,

In eukaryotes, the citric acid cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. The TCA cycle begins with acetyl-CoA transferring its two-carbon acetyl group to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate). The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing first one, then a second carboxyl group as CO2. The carbons lost as CO2 originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO2 requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in anabolism, they may not be lost since many TCA cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules. Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich electrons to NAD+, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced. At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.",NA,

Digestion of the limit dextrins and disaccharides, both dietary and starch-derived, to monosaccharides â?glucose, galactose, and fructose â?is accomplished by enzymes located on the luminal surfaces of enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine.  Once released from starch or once ingested, sucrose can be degraded into beta-D-fructose and alpha-D-glucose via lysosomal alpha-glucosidase or sucrose-isomaltase.  Beta-D-fructose can be converted to beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate by glucokinase and then to alpha-D-glucose-6-phosphate by the action of glucose phosphate isomerase.  Phosphoglucomutase 1 can then act on alpha-D-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to generate alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate.  Alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate (G6P) has several possible fates.  It can enter into gluconeogenesis, glycolysis or the nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway.  UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 can convert alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate into UDP-glucose, which can then be converted to UDP-xylose or UDP-glucuronate and, eventually to glucuronate.  UDP-glucose can also serve as a precursor to the synthesis of glycogen via glycogen synthase.  More specifically, glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (Î±1â?) bonded glucose.  As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen.  The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (Î±1â?) to (Î±1â?) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule.  The branching enzyme can only act upon a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.  Another enzyme known as starch phosphorylase or glycogen phosphorylase can also convert starch into glycogen.  Glycogen functions as the secondary short term energy storage in animal cells.  It is made primarily by the liver and the muscles, but can also be made by glycogenesis within the brain and stomach.  Glycogen is the analogue of starch, a less branched glucose polymer in plants, and is commonly referred to as animal starch, having a similar structure to amylopectin.  Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle.  Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate that is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P).  G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel or G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars or, in the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase.

The series of reactions that form urea is known as the Urea Cycle (Ornithine Cylce) or the Krebs-Henseleit Cycle. The essential features of the urea cycle reactions and their metabolic regulation are as follows: Arginine from the diet or from protein breakdown is cleaved by the cytosolic enzyme arginase, generating urea and ornithine. In subsequent reactions of the urea cycle a new urea residue is built on the ornithine, regenerating arginine and perpetuating the cycle. Ornithine arising in the cytosol is transported to the mitochondrial matrix, where ornithine transcabamoylase catalyzes the condensation of ornithine with carbamoyl phosphate, producing citrulline. The energy for the reaction is provided by the high-energy anhydride of carbamoyl phosphate. The product, citrulline, is then transported to the cytosol, where the remaining reactions of the cycle take place. The synthesis of citrulline requires a prior activation of carbon and nitrogen as carbamoyl phosphate (CP). The activation step requires 2 equivalents of ATP and the mitochondrial matrix enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-I (CPS-I). In a 2-step reaction, catalyzed by cytosolic argininosuccinate synthetase, citrulline and aspartate are condensed to form argininosuccinate. The reaction involves the addition of AMP (from ATP) to the amido carbonyl of citrulline, forming an activated intermediate on the enzyme surface (AMP-citrulline), and the subsequent addition of aspartate to form argininosuccinate. Arginine and fumarate are produced from argininosuccinate by the cytosolic enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. In the final step of the cycle arginase cleaves urea from aspartate, regenerating cytosolic ornithine, which can be transported to the mitochondrial matrix for another round of urea synthesis. The fumarate, generated via the action of arginiosuccinate lyase, is reconverted to aspartate for use in the argininosuccinate synthetase reaction.",NA,

It is the end product of glycolysis and the starting point for gluconeogenesis, and can be generated by transamination of alanine. It can be converted by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to acetyl CoA which can enter the TCA cycle or serve as the starting point for the synthesis of long chain fatty acids, steroids, and ketone bodies. It also plays a central role in balancing the energy needs of various tissues in the body. Under conditions in which oxygen supply is limiting, (in exercising muscle) or in the absence of mitochondria, (in red blood cells), re-oxidation of NADH produced by glycolysis cannot be coupled to generation of ATP. Instead, its re-oxidation is coupled to the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. This lactate is released into the blood, and is taken up primarily by the liver, where it is oxidized to pyruvate and can be used for gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate participates in several key reactions and pathways. In glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible. In gluconeogenesis pyruvate requires two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP. In fatty acid synthesis, pyruvate decarboxylation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex produces acetyl-CoA. In gluconeogenesis, the carboxylation by pyruvate carboxylase produces oxaloacetate. The fate of pyruvate depends on the cell energy charge. In cells or tissues with a high energy charge pyruvate is directed toward gluconeogenesis, but when the energy charge is low pyruvate is preferentially oxidized to CO2 and H2O in the TCA cycle, with generation of 15 equivalents of ATP per pyruvate. The enzymatic activities of the TCA cycle are located in the mitochondrion. When transported into the mitochondrion, pyruvate encounters two principal metabolizing enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase (a gluconeogenic enzyme) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). With a high cell-energy charge, acetyl-CoA, is able allosterically to activate pyruvate carboxylase, directing pyruvate toward gluconeogenesis. When the energy charge is low CoA is not acylated, pyruvate carboxylase is inactive, and pyruvate is preferentially metabolized via the PDH complex and the enzymes of the TCA cycle to CO2 and H2O.",NA,

This means that it cannot be synthesized by the organism and therefore must be part of its diet. Amino acids, including tryptophan, act as building blocks in protein biosynthesis through the action of tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for serotonin (a neurotransmitter), which is synthesized via tryptophan hydroxylase. Serotonin, in turn, can be converted to melatonin (a neurohormone), via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities. Niacin via synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids as key biosynthetic intermediates. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in tryptophanâs catabolic pathway leading to 3 fates: First, kynurenine can undergo deamination in a standard transamination reaction yielding kynurenic acid. Secondly, kynurenine can undergo a series of catabolic reactions producing 3-hydroxyanthranilate plus alanine. In this reaction, kynureninase catabolizes the conversion of kynurenine into anthranilic acid while kynurenineâoxoglutarate transaminase (also known as Kynurenine amino-transferase and glutamine transaminase K, GTK) catabolizes its conversion into kynurenic acid and kynurenine 3-hydroxylase - to 3-hydroxykynurenine. The oxidation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate converts it into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic 6-semialdehyde, which has two fates, it can either degrade to acetoacetate or it can cyclize to quinolate. Most of the bodyâs 3-hydroxyanthranilate leads to acetoacetate which is why tryptophan is also a ketogenic amino acid. An important side reaction in liver involves a non-enzymatic cyclization to quinolate then via a transamination and several rearrangements yields limited amounts of nicotinic acid, which leads to production of a small amount of NAD+ and NADP+.",NA,

Many steroid hormones are transformed by sulfatases, dehydrogenases and glucuronide transferases to enhance their solubility and to facilitate their elimination. Inactivation refers to the metabolic conversion of a biologically active compound into an inactive one. Peripheral inactivation (e.g. by liver enzymes) is required to ensure steady-state levels of plasma androgens and estrogens. Specifically, if an androgen or estrogen is to act as a "" chemical signal "", its half-life in the circulation must be limited, so that any change in secretion rate is immediately reflected by a change in its plasma concentration. But hormone inactivation can also occur in target tissues, notably after the hormone has triggered the relevant biological effects in order to ensure termination of hormone action. The main site of peripheral androgen/estrogen inactivation and catabolism is the liver, but some catabolic activity also occurs in the kidneys. Inactive androgens and estrogens are mainly eliminated as urinary (mostly conjugated) metabolites.

Acetoacetic acid can also be catalyzed by mitochondrial D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to form (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid with NADH. Ketogenesis occurs mostly during fasting and starvation.  Stored fatty acids will be broken down and mobilized to produce large amount of acetyl-CoA for ketogenesis in liver, which can reduce the demand of glucose for other tissues. Acetone cannot be converted back to acetyl-CoA; therefore, they are either breathed out through the lungs or excreted in urine.",NA,

Retinol is among the most usable forms of vitamin A, which also include retinal (aldehyde form), retinoic acid (acid form) and retinyl ester (ester form). Retinol is normaly ingested in a precursor form. Typically animal sources (liver and eggs) contain retinyl esters, whereas plants (carrots, spinach) contain pro-vitamin A carotenoids. Hydrolysis of retinyl esters results in retinol, while pro-vitamin A carotenoids can be cleaved to produce retinal. Retinal (retinaldehyde) can be reversibly reduced to produce retinol or it can be irreversibly oxidized to produce retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is derived from retinol by oxidation through retinol and retinal dehydrogenases and several cytochrome p450s (CYPs). Many different geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and retinoic acid are possible as a result of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration. Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Retinoic acid plays an important role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Retinoic acid can be oxidized to several metabolites by a panel of CYPs that differs for the different retinoic acid isomers. CYP26A1 is involved in the metabolic breakdown of retinoic acid by 4-hydroxylation. CYP26A1-mediated 4-hydroxylation is specific for all-trans-retinoic acid but not for the isomers 13-cis-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid. CYP26C1 can also hydroxylate the trans form of retinoic acid it is unique in hydroxylating the 9-cis isomer of retinoic acid. CYP26B1 can also deactivate all-trans-retinoic acid by 4-hydroxylation. Another recently discovered cytochrome P450, called CYP2S1 is expressed in skin cells and is inducible by UV radiation, coal tar and all-trans retinoate. All trans retinoic acid also serves as a substrate for this enzyme. Phase II metabolism, mainly glucuronidation, is also observed for retinoic acid.",NA,

In resting cells arachidonic acid is present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) of membranes of the bodyâs cells, and is particularly abundant in the brain. Typically a receptor-dependent event, requiring a transducing G protein, initiates phospholipid hydrolysis and releases the fatty acid into the intracellular medium. Three enzymes mediate this deacylation reaction including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C (PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). Once released, free arachidonate has three possible fates: 1) reincorporation into phospholipids, 2) diffusion outside the cell, and 3) metabolism. Arachidonate metabolism is carried out by three distinct enzyme classes: cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450âs. Specifically, the enzymes cyclooxygenase and peroxidase lead to the synthesis of prostaglandin H2, which in turn is used to produce the prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase leads to 5-HPETE, which in turn is used to produce the leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and lipoxins. Some arachidonic acid is converted into midchain HETEs, omega-chain HETEs, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by cytochrome P450 epoxygenase hydroxylase activity. Several products of these pathways act within neurons to modulate the activities of ion channels, protein kinases, ion pumps, and neurotransmitter uptake systems, affecting processes such as cellular proliferation, inflammation, and hemostasis.

It consists of a pyrimidine ring (2,5-dimethyl-6-aminopyrimidine) and a thiazolium ring (4-methyl-5-hydroxy ethyl thiazole) joined by a methylene bridge. Thiamine is found in a wide variety of foods at low concentrations. Yeast and pork are the most highly concentrated sources of thiamine. Cereal grains, however, are generally the most important dietary sources of thiamine, by virtue of their ubiquity. Of these, whole grains contain more thiamine than refined grains. Thiamine is released by the action of phosphatase and pyrophosphatase in the upper small intestine. At low concentrations the process is carrier mediated and at higher concentrations, absorption occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport is greatest in the jejunum and ileum (it is inhibited by alcohol consumption and by folic deficiency). The majority of thiamine in serum is bound to proteins, mainly albumin. Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. About 80% of intracellular thiamine is phosphorylated and most is bound to proteins. Thiamine and its acid metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid and thiamine acetic acid) are excreted principally in the urine. Thiamine is mainly the transport form of the vitamin, while the active forms are phosphorylated thiamine derivatives. There are four known natural thiamine phosphate derivatives: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and the recently discovered adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP) and adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP). Thiamine monophosphate (TMP) is an intermediate to facilitate the synthesis of free thiamine to thiamine diphosphate and triphosphate. The synthesis of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also known as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) or cocarboxylase, is catalyzed by an enzyme called thiamine diphosphokinase. TPP activates decarboxylation of pyruvate in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

Alanine plays a key role in glucose-alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group through the action of alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, forming alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The alanine formed is passed into the blood and transported to the liver. A reverse of the alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in liver. Pyruvate regenerated forms glucose through gluconeogenesis, which returns to muscle through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and degrades into ammonium ion through the action of glutamate dehydrogenase, which in turn participates in the urea cycle to form urea. The glucose-alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from the muscle and find their way to the liver. Glucose is regenerated from pyruvate and then returned to muscle.

Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis. Several non-carbohydrate carbon substrates can enter the gluconeogenesis pathway. One common substrate is lactic acid, formed during anaerobic respiration in skeletal muscle. Lactate may also come from red blood cells, which obtain energy solely from glycolysis as they have no membrane-bound organelles for aerobic respiration. Lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase.

This allows the hydrogen ions of the cofactor NADH produced in the cytosol to reach the electron transport chain in the mitochondria and generate ATP. The shuttle system is required because the inner membrane is impermeable to NADH and its oxidized form NAD+. NAD+/NADH does not cross the membrane, only ions (attached to malate) cross it. In this particular shuttle process, oxaloacetate on the cytoplasmic side is first reduced by NADH, creating malate and NAD+. Malate and the electrons it carries are transported into the mitochondria across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in exchange for alpha-ketoglutarate, which is transported out of the mitochondria. Once inside, the energy in malate is extracted again by reducing NAD+ to make NADH, thereby regenerating oxaloacetate. This NADH is then free to transfer its electrons to the electron transport chain. The oxaloacetate is transaminated with glutamate to make aspartate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Aspartate is returned to the cytosol by the aspartate-glutamate transporter, which moves glutamate into the mitochondria as it transports aspartate out.

Products of steroidogenesis include androgens, testosterone, estrogens and progesterone, corticoids, cortisol and aldosterone.  The first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones is the synthesis of pregnenolone from cholesterol.  In this process, cholesterol mobilized from cytosolic lipid droplets or from lysosomes is transported to mitochondria and becomes localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane.  In the inner mitochondrial membrane, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone in a sequence of three reactions, all catalyzed by CYP11A (side chain cleavage enzyme).  Finally, pregnenolone re-enters the cytosol.  Pregnenolone is converted to progesterone in two reactions, both catalyzed by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.  Progesterone is hydroxylated by CYP21A2 to form deoxycorticosterone, which in turn is converted to aldosterone in a three-reaction sequence catalyzed by CYP11B2.  Pregnenolone is converted to 17alpha-hydoxyprogesterone in two reactions, both catalyzed by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.  17Alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is hydroxylated by CYP21A2 to form 11-deoxycortisol, which in turn is converted to cortisol by CYP11B1.  The conversion of the active steroid hormone, cortisol, to inactive cortisone occurs in many tissues, notably the liver.  Testosterone biosynthesis begins with pregnenolone.  Subsequent steps require several enzymes including, 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17Î±-hydroxylase/C17-20-lyase and 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3.  Specifically, pregnenolone is converted to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone by CYP17 (17Î±-hydroxylase).  Dehydroepiandrosterone is then converted to androstenedione by 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.  Androstenedione can have two fates, it can either be converted to estrone via CYP19 (aromatase/estrogen synthase) or it can be converted to testosterone via 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.  Free testosterone is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5-alpha reductase.

A neuron consists of a cell body, branched dendrites to receive sensory information, and a long singular axon to transmit motor information. Signals travel from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another via a synapse. Neurons maintain a voltage gradient across their membrane using metabolically driven ion pumps and ion channels for charge-carrying ions, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Clâ?, and calcium (Ca2+).  The resting membrane potential (charge) of a neuron is about -70 mV because there is an accumulation of more sodium ions outside the neuron compared to the number of potassium ions inside.  If the membrane potential changes by a large enough amount, an electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated. Stimuli such as pressure, stretch, and chemical transmitters can activate a neuron by causing specific ion-channels to open, changing the membrane potential. During this period, called depolarization, the sodium channels open to allow sodium to rush into the cell which results in the membrane potential to increase.  Once the interior of the neuron becomes more positively charged, the sodium channels close and the potassium channels open to allow potassium to move out of the cell to try and restore the resting membrane potential (this stage is called repolarization).  There is a period of hyperpolarization after this step because the potassium channels are slow to close, thus allowing more potassium outside the cell than necessary. The resting potential is restored after the sodium-potassium pump works to exchange three sodium ions out per two potassium ions in across the plasma membrane.  The action potential travels along the axon and upon reaching the end, causes neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine to be released into the synapse.

The fourth is a nonoxidative pathway which is less well studied but known to produce fatty acid ethyl esters. Each of the three oxidative pathways is differentiated by the mechanism utilized to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde in the first step. In the alcohol dehydrogenase mediated ethanol degradation pathway (I), cytoplasmic alcohol dehydrogenase produces the acetaldehyde from the ethanol. In the MEOS mediated ethanol degradation pathway (II), the ethanol enters the endoplasmic reticulum, where the Microsomal Ethanol Oxidising System (MEOS), also know as also known as cytochrome P-450 2E1, does the oxidizing and returns the acetaldehyde to the cytoplasm. In the catalase mediated ethanol degradation pathway (III), the oxidation occurs in the peroxisome via peroxisomal catalase, with the resulting acetaldehyde being released to the cytoplasm. In each of the three oxidative pathways the cytosolic acetaldehyde then enters the mitochondrial compartment, where it is converted to acetate by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. The acetate leaves the mitochondria and moves to extra-hepatic tissues for further metabolism. In extra-hepatic cells the acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA via either cytoplasmic or mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase.

Like other 2-keto acids, degradation of 2-oxobutanoate occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and begins with oxidative decarboxylation to its acyl coenzyme A derivative, propionyl-CoA.  This reaction is mediated by a class of large, multienzyme complexes called 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes.  While no 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex is specific to 2-oxobutanoate, numerous complexes can catalyze its reaction.  In this pathway the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex is depicted.  All 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes consist of three main components: a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1) with a thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor, a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) with a lipoate cofactor, and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) with a flavin cofactor.  E1 binds the 2-oxobutanoate to the lipoate on E2, which then transfers the propionyl group to coenzyme A, producing propionyl-CoA and reducing the lipoate.  E3 then transfers protons to NAD in order to restore the lipoate.  Propionyl-CoA carboxylase transforms the propionyl-CoA to S-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then converted to R-methylmalonyl-CoA via methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase.

Pyruvaldehyde is formed in low concentrations by glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and protein metabolism. Pyruvaldehyde is catalyzed by the glyoxylase system, composed of the enzymes lactoylglutathione lyase (glyoxalase I) and glyoxylase II. Glyoxalase I catalyes the isomerization of the spontaneously formed hemithioacetal adduct between glutathione and pyruvaldehyde into S-lactoylglutathione.

There are a number of different inositol phosphates found in mammals, distinguishable by the number and position of the phosphate groups. Inositol phosphate can be formed either as a product of phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism or from glucose 6-phosphate via the enzyme inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1. Conversion between the different types of inositol phosphates then occurs via a number of specific inositol phosphate kinases and phosphatases, which add (kinase) or remove (phosphatase) phosphate groups.

Phosphoinositides regulate a variety of signal transduction processes, thus playing a number of important roles in the cell, such as actin cytoskeletal reorganization, membrane transport, and cell proliferation. They may also affect protein localization, aggregation, and activity by acting as secondary messengers. The ability of the cell to recognize the different types of phosphoinositides as different cellular signals means that their synthesis and metabolism must be tightly regulated.

Vitamin K is an important dietary component because it is necessary as a cofacter in the activation of vitamin K dependent proteins. Metabolism of vitamin K occurs mainly in the liver. In the first step, vitamin K is reduced to its quinone form by a quinone reductase such as NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Reduced vitamin K is the form required to convert vitamin K dependent protein precursors to their active states. It acts as a cofactor to the integral membrane enzyme vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase (along with water and carbon dioxide as co-substrates), which carboxylates glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues on certain proteins, activating them. Each converted glutamyl residue produces a molecule of vitamin K epoxide, and certain proteins may have more than one residue requiring carboxylation. To complete the cycle, the vitamin K epoxide is returned to vitamin K via the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme, also an integral membrane protein.

Carnitine can be obtained from dietary sources and also biosynthesized. It is necessary for fatty acid oxidation, transporting fatty acids from the cystosol to the mitochondria, where they are broken down via the citric acid cycle to release energy. Carnitine is synthesized from lysine residues in existing proteins. These residues are methylated using lysine methyltransferase enzymes and methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine, then removed from the protein via hydrolysis. In the next step, the N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine is converted to 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine t via the mitochondrial enzyme trimethyllysine dioxygenase.

Acetyl-CoA is made in the mitochondria by metabolizing fatty acids, and the oxidation of pyruvate of acetyl-CoA. When the body has an excess of ATP, the energy in acetyl-Coa can be stored in the form of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA must cross the mitochondrial membrane to the cytosol, where fatty acid synthesis takes place. Acetyl-CoA is combined with oxalacetic acid by the enzyme citrate synthase, creating citric acid. Citric acid is then transported out of the mitochondria, to the cytosol, where the enzyme citrate lyase converts citric acid back into acetyl-CoA and oxalacetic acid. Malate dehydrogenase reduces oxalacetic acid to malate, which then is either transported back into the mitochondria by the malate-alpha ketoglutarate transporter or oxidized to pyruvate by malic enzyme.

It is thought to be implicated in anhydrobiosis â?the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, generally lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/reyhdration cycle. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1-1 alpha bond giving it the name of alpha-D-glucopyranoglucopyranosyl-1,1-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore stable in solution at high temperatures even under acidic conditions. The bonding also keeps non-reducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end-groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). The enzyme trehalase, present but not abundant in most people, breaks it into two glucose molecules, which can then be readily absorbed in the gut. Trehalose degradation begins with trehalose being broken into beta-D-glucose in the intestine by the trehalose-specific disaccaridase trehalase.

ROS are highly reactive due to unpaired valence shell electrons, and can cause serious damage to cells and cell organelles. The environment also may cause ROS to form, from sources such as drought, air pollutants, UV light, cold temperatures, and external chemicals. An organic example of ROS being formed is during the beta oxidation of fatty acids, or photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms. Aerobic organisms who produce energy through the electron transport chain in mitochondria produce ROS as a byproduct. ROS damage commmonly includes DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, oxidation of amino acids in proteins, and oxidatively inactivating enzymes by oxidation of cofactors. Most aerobic organisms have adapted to this dangerous condition of life, and have a system of enzymes and scavenging free radicals. Enzymes such as are essential for defense against ROS, and include superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidase (CAT).

Plasmalogens are thought to influence membrane dynamics and fatty acid levels, while also having roles in intracellular signalling and as antioxidants.  Plasmalogens consist of a glycerol backbone with an vinyl-ether-linked alkyl chain at the sn-1 position, an ester-linked long-chain fatty acid at the sn-2 position, and a head group attached to the sn-3 position through a phosphodiester linkage.  It is the vinyl-ether-linkage that separates plasmalogens from other phospholipids.   Plasmalogen biosynthesis begins in the peroxisomes, where the integral membrane protein dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT) catalyzes the esterification of the free hydroxyl group of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with a molecule any of long chain acyl CoA.  Next, alkyl-DHAP synthase, a peroxisomal enzyme associated with DHAPAT, replaces the fatty acid on the DHAP with a long chain fatty alcohol.  The third step of plasmalogen biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase, which is found in the membrane of both the peroxisome and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase uses NADPH as a cofactor to reduce the ketone of the 1-alkyl-DHAP using a classical hydride transfer mechanism.  The remainder of plasmalogen synthesis occurs using enzymes in the ER.  Lysophosphatidate acyltransferases (LPA-ATs) transfer the acyl component of a polyunsaturated acyl-CoA to the the 1-alkyl-DHAP, creating a 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol 3-phosphate.  The phosphate is then removed by lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase I (PAP-I), and the head group is attached by a choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase.  The majority of plasmalogens have either ethanolamine or choline as a headgroup, although a small amount of serine and inositol-linked ether-phospholipids can also be found.  In the final step, the vinyl-ether linkage is created by plasmanylethanolamine desaturase, which catalyzes the formation of a double bond in the alkyl chain of the plasmalogen.",NA,

Angiotensin II, the primary agent to inducing an increased blood pressure, is formed in the general circulation when it is cleaved from a string of precursor molecules.  Angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin I with the action of renin, an enzyme secreted from the kidneys.  From there, angiotensin I is converted to the central agent, angiotensin II, with the aid of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) so that it is available in the circulation to act on numerous areas in the body when an increase in blood pressure is needed.  

Angiotensin II can act directly on receptors on the smooth muscle cells of the tunica media layer in the blood vessel to induce vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure.  However, it can also influence the blood pressure by aiding in an increase of the circulating blood volume.  Angiotensin II can cause vasopressin to be released, which is a hormone involved in regulating water reabsorption.  Vasopressin is created in the supraoptic nuclei and they travel down the neurosecretory neuron axon to be stored in the neuronal terminals within the posterior pituitary.  Angiotensin II in the cerebral circulation triggers the release of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland.  From there, vasopressin enters into the systemic blood circulation where it eventually binds to receptors on epithelial cells in the collecting ducts of the nephron.   The binding of vasopressin causes vesicles of epithelial cells to fuse with the plasma membrane.  These vesicles contain aquaporin II, which are proteins that act as water channels once they have bound to the plasma membrane.  As a result, the permeability of the collecting duct changes to allow for water reabsorption back into the blood circulation.  Angiotensin II also has an effect on the hypothalmus, where it helps trigger a thirst sensation.  Correspondingly, there will be an increase in oral water uptake into the body, which would then also increase the circulating blood volume.  Another way that angiotensin II helps increase the blood volume is by acting on the adrenal cortex to stimulate aldosterone release, which is responsible for increasing sodium reuptake in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting duct.  It is formed when angiotensin II binds to receptors on the zona glomerulosa cells in the adrenal cortex, which triggers a signaling cascade that eventually activates the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein to allow for cholesterol uptake into the mitochondria.  Cholesterol then undergoes a series of reactions during steroidogenesis, which is a process that ultimately leads to the synthesis of aldosterone from cholesterol. Aldosterone then goes to act on the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct to make them more permeable to sodium to allow for its reuptake.  Water subsequently follows sodium back into the system, which would therefore increase the circulating blood volume.  In addition, potassium and hydrogen are also being excreted into the urine simultaneously to maintain the electrolyte balance.",NA,

In addition, it aids in the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals and also acts as one of the body's first line of defence by killing ingested micro-organisms.  This digestive fluid is formed in the stomach (specifically by the parietal cells) and is mainly composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl).  However, it is also constituted of potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The main stimulants of acid secretion are histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine which all, after binding to their respective receptors on the parietal cell membrane, trigger a G-protein signalling cascade that causes the activation of the H+/K+ ATPase proton pump. As a result, hydrogen ions are able to be pumped out of the parietal cell and into the lumen of the stomach.  The hydrogen ions are available inside the parietal cell after water and carbon dioxide combine to form carbonic acid(the reaction is catalyzed by the carbonic anhydrase enzyme) which dissociates into a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion.  Moreover, the chloride and potassium ions are transported into the stomach lumen through their own channels so that hydrogen ions and/or potassium ions can form an ionic bond with chloride ions to form HCl and/or KCl, which are both constituents of stomach acid.  In addition, the peptide hormone somatostatin is the main inhibitor to gastric acid secretion.  Not only does it inhibit the G-protein signalling cascade that leads to proton pump activation, but it also directly acts on the enterochromaffin-like cells and G cells to inhibit histamine and gastrin release, respectively.",NA,

Conversion of androstenedione to estrone involves three successive reactions catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase (cytochrome P450 19A1). Androstenedione can also be converted into etiocholanolone glucuronide, androsterone glucuronide, and adrenosterone.

Its various actions are mediated by histamine receptors H1, H2, H3, and H4. Histamine receptor H1 belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and it is expressed in smooth muscles, on vascular endothelial cells, in the heart, and in the central nervous system. It is linked to an intracellular G-protein (GÎ±q) that activates phospholipase C and the phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) signalling pathway which promotes inflammatory processes through calcium ion release and expression of the NF-ÎºB immune response transcription factor. H1-antihistamines inactivate the H1 receptor and are administered to attenuate inflammatory process in order to treat conditions such as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and urticaria. Upon binding by histamine, the H1 receptor allosterically activates the G-protein by exchanging GDP for GTP at the G-protein's alpha subunit (GÎ±q). This results in the dissociation of a GÎ±q-GTP monomer and a GÎ²Î³ dimer from the receptor (Wikipedia). GÎ±q-GTP activates phospholipase C-beta which cleaves the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the secondary messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
